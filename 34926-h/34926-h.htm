<h2>The Camp Fire Girls in<br />
After Years</h2>


<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'><span class="smcap">The Inaugural Ball</span><br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>FACING the hills, the great house
had a wonderful view of the curving
banks of a river.</div>

<p>Half an hour before sunset a number
of workmen hurried away across the
grounds, while a little later from behind
the closed blinds glowed hundreds of softly
shaded electric lights. The lawns were
strung with rows and rows of small lamps
suspended from one giant tree to the
next, but waiting for actual darkness to
descend before shedding forth their illumination.</p>

<p>Evidently preparations had been made
on a splendid scale, both inside the house
and out, for an entertainment of some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
kind. Yet curiously there seemed to be
a strange hush over everything, a sense
of anxiety and suspense pervading the
very atmosphere. Then, in odd contrast
to the other lights, the room on the third
floor to the left was in almost total darkness
save for a single tiny flame no larger
than a nurse's covered candle.</p>

<p>At about half-past six o'clock suddenly
and with almost no noise the front door
of the house opened. The next moment
a slight form appeared upon the flight of
broad steps and gazed down the avenue.
From behind her came the mingled fragrance
of roses and violets, while before
her arose the even more delicious tang of
earth and grass and softly drifting autumn
leaves of the late October evening.</p>

<p>Nevertheless neither the beauty of the
evening nor its perfumes attracted the girl's
attention, for her expression remained grave
and frightened, and without appearing
aware of it she sighed several times.</p>

<p>Small and dark, with an extraordinary
quantity of almost blue-black hair and a
thin white face dominated by a pair of
unhappy dark eyes, the girl's figure suggested<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
a child, although she was plainly
older. In her hand she carried a cane
upon which she leaned slightly.</p>

<p>"It does seem too hard for this trouble
to have come at this particular time," she
murmured in unconscious earnestness. "If
only I could do something to help, yet
there is absolutely nothing, of course,
except to wait. Still, I wish Faith would
come home."</p>

<p>Then, after peering for another moment
down the avenue of old elms and maple
trees, she turned and went back into the
house, closing the door behind her and
moving almost noiselessly.</p>

<p>For the present no one else was to be
seen, at least in the front part of the big
mansion, except the solitary figure of this
young girl, who looked somewhat incongruous
and out of place in her handsome
surroundings. Notwithstanding, she seemed
perfectly at home and was plainly neither
awed by nor unfamiliar with them. The
hall was decorated with palms and evergreens
and festoons of vines, and adorning
the high walls were portraits, most of them
of men of stern countenance and of a past<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
generation, while here and there stood a
marble bust. But without regarding any
of these things with special attention the
girl walked quickly past them and entered
the drawing room on the right. Then at
last her face brightened.</p>

<p>Surely the room was beautiful enough
to have attracted any one's attention,
although it was not exactly the kind of
room one would see in a private house,
for it happened to be in the Governor's
mansion in the state of New Hampshire.</p>

<p>In preparation for the evening's entertainment
the furniture had been moved
away except for a number of chairs and
divans. The two tall marble mantels were
banked with roses and violets and baskets
of roses swung from the two crystal
chandeliers.</p>

<p>With a murmured exclamation the girl
dropped down on a low stool in the corner
where the evergreens almost entirely concealed
her and where she appeared more
like an elf creature that had come into
the house with the green things surrounding
her than an everyday girl. For a
quarter of an hour she must have remained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
there alone, when she was aroused from
her reverie by some one's entrance. Then,
although the girl did not move or speak,
her whole face changed and the sullen,
unhappy look disappeared, while oddly
her eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>There could have been nothing fairer
in the room than the woman who had
just come quietly into it. She must have
been about twenty-eight years old; her
hair was a beautiful auburn, like sunshine
on certain brown and red leaves in the
woods in late October; her eyes were gray,
and she was of little more than medium
height, with slender hips, but a full throat
and chest. At the present moment she
was wearing a house gown of light blue
cashmere, and although she looked as if
life might always before have been kind
to her, at present her face was pale and
there were marks of sleeplessness about
her eyes and mouth.</p>

<p>Apparently trying to summon an interest
in her surroundings which she scarcely
felt, she glanced about the room until
her eyes rested on the silent girl.</p>

<p>"Why, Angel, what are you doing in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
here alone, child? How lovely everything
looks, and yet I am afraid I cannot come
down to receive people tonight. All afternoon
I have been trying to make up my
mind to attempt it and each moment it
seems more impossible."</p>

<p>Then with a gesture indicating both
fatigue and discouragement the woman
sat down, folding her hands in her lap.</p>

<p>"But the baby isn't any worse, I heard
only half an hour ago," the younger girl
interrupted quickly, and in answer to a
shake of the head from her companion
went on: "You simply must be present
tonight, Princess. This is the greatest
night in your husband's career and
you know the Inaugural Ball would be
an entire failure without you! Staying
up-stairs won't do little Tony any good.
And think what it would mean to the
Governor to have to manage all alone!
You know you promised Anthony before
his election that you would attend to the
social side of his office for him, as he declared
he didn't know enough to undertake
it. So you can't desert him at the
very beginning."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Swiftly Angelique Martins crossed the
room and seated herself on the arm of her
friend's chair. "I promise you on my
honor that I shall sit just outside little
Tony's bedroom the entire evening and
if he is even the tiniest bit worse I shall
come down and tell you on the instant."</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence and then
the newly elected Governor's wife replied:
"I suppose you are right, Angel, and I
must try to do what you say, for nothing
else is fair to Anthony. Yet I never
dreamed of ever having to choose between
my love and duty to my baby and my
husband! But dear me, I am sure I have
not the faintest idea how the Governor's
Lady should behave at her first reception,
even if I have to make my d&eacute;but in the
character in the next few hours."</p>

<p>Then, in a lighter tone than she had yet
used in their conversation, Betty Ashton,
who was now Mrs. Governor Graham,
smiled, placing her hand for a moment
on that of her companion.</p>

<p>For the friendship between Betty Ashton
and the little French girl whom she
had discovered at the hospital in Boston<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
had never wavered even after the Betty
of the Camp Fire days had become Mrs.
Anthony Graham, wife of the youngest
governor ever elected to the highest office
in his state. Moreover, Betty and Anthony
now had two children of their own, the
little Tony, a baby of about two years
old, who was now dangerously ill on the
top floor of the Governor's mansion, and
Bettina, who was six.</p>

<p>Angelique Martins was almost like an
adoring younger sister. She was approaching
twenty; yet on account of her lameness
and shyness she appeared much
younger. But she was one of the odd
girls who in some ways are like children
and yet in others are older than people
ever dream. After her mother's death,
several years before, she had come to live
with Betty and Anthony and held a position
as an assistant stenographer in the
Governor's office. Ordinarily she was
strangely silent and reserved, so that no
one, not even her best friend, entirely
understood her.</p>

<p>"But you must not miss the ball tonight,
Angel," Betty now continued more cheerfully.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
"You and Faith have been talking
of it for weeks, and so I can't have you
sacrifice yourself for me. Besides, one of
the nurses can do what you offered and
send me a message if I am needed. Don't
you remember that your dress is even
prettier than Faith's? I was perfectly
determined it should be." And Betty
smiled, amused at herself. She was always
a little jealous for her prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Faith
Barton. It was true that since their first
meeting at Sunrise Cabin the two girls
had become close friends. But then Betty
could seldom fail to see, just as she had
in the beginning, the painful contrast between
them. Faith had grown into a
beautiful girl and Dr. Barton and Rose
were entirely devoted to her; and she
had also both charm and talent, although
still given to impossible dreams about
people and things.</p>

<p>Angel now shook her head. "You know
you would feel safer with me to stand
guard over Tony than if you had only
one of the servants," she argued a little
resentfully. Then with her cheeks crimsoning:
"Besides, Princess, you know that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
I perfectly loathe having to meet strangers.
No one in the world except you could
ever have induced me even to think of it.
I am ever so much happier alone with you
and the children or pegging away at my
typewriter at the office. I believe people
ought to remain where they belong in
this world, and you can't possibly make
me look like Faith by dressing me up in
pretty clothes. I should never conceive
of being her rival in anything."</p>

<p>There was a curious note in the lame
girl's voice that passed unnoticed, for her
companion suddenly inquired: "By the
way, dear, do you know what has become
of Faith? I passed her room and she was
not there. I hope she is not out alone.
I know she has a fashion of loving to go
about in the twilight, dreaming her dreams
and composing verse. Still, when she is
here visiting me I would much rather she
did not."</p>

<p>"But Faith isn't alone. She is with
the Governor's secretary, Kenneth Helm,"
Angel answered. "Mr. Helm came to the
house with a message and Faith asked him
to go out with her."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Betty smiled. Faith Barton scorned
conventionalities and felt sure that she
was above certain of them. "Oh, I did
not know Kenneth and Faith had learned
to know each other so well in two weeks'
time," she replied carelessly, her attention
wandering to the little Tony up-stairs.
"However, Faith is all right if she is
with Kenneth. I know Anthony has
the greatest possible trust in him or he
would never have selected him for his
secretary in such troublesome political
times as these. I don't believe you seem
to like Kenneth as much as you once
did. But you must not be prejudiced
against so many people. He used to be
very kind to you."</p>

<p>Without waiting for Angel's reply Betty
walked away. If she could have seen her
expression she might have been surprised
or annoyed.</p>

<p>For sometimes Angel had wondered if it
would be wise for her to take her friend
into her confidence. Surely she had reasons
for not being so sure of the Governor's
confidence in his secretary. But then
what proof had she to offer against him?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Besides, people often considered her suspicious
and unfriendly. Moreover, in this
case the French girl did not altogether
trust herself. Was there not some personal
reason in her dislike? It was entirely
true that she had not felt like this in the
beginning of their acquaintance.</p>

<p>With a feeling of irritation against herself,
Angel started to leave the drawing
room. This was plainly no time for worrying
over the future; she must go and have
something to eat at once so as to be able
to help watch the baby. There was only
one regret the girl felt at her own decision.
She was sorry not to see Betty receiving
her guests at the Inaugural Ball tonight.
For her friend remained her ideal of what
a great lady should be in the best sense.
Moreover, there would be other old friends
whom she had once known at Sunrise
Cabin. However, some of them were
guests at the mansion, so she could meet
them later.</p>

<p>Out in the hall the little French girl
now discovered Faith and Kenneth Helm
returning from their walk. The Governor's
private secretary must have been about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
twenty-four or five years old. He was a
Yale graduate and had light-brown hair
and eyes of almost the same color. He
had the shoulders of an athlete, a clear,
bright complexion, and as Angel watched
them she could not deny that he had a
particularly charming smile. However, he
was assuredly not looking at her. It was
absurd to care, of course, yet nevertheless
even the humblest person scarcely likes
being wilfully ignored. And Angel was
sure that the young man had seen her,
even though he gave no appearance of
having done so.</p>

<p>The next moment, after her companion's
departure, Faith Barton turned to her
friend. Faith's cheeks were delicately
flushed from her walk in the autumn air
and her pale gold hair was blowing about
her face. Her blue eyes were wide open
and clear and she looked curiously innocent
of any wrong or misfortune in the world.
Surely there were seldom two girls offering
a more complete contrast than the two
who now tiptoed softly down the long
hall together.</p>

<p>"I am going to rest a little while," Faith<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
said at parting. "But do let us try to
have a long, quiet talk tomorrow. I want
to tell you a secret that no one else in the
world must know for the present."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'><span class="smcap">New Names for Old Acquaintances</span><br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>THERE was a shimmer of silver
and blue on the stairs and then
the man with his eyes upturned
saw his wife moving toward him in a
kind of cloud.</div>

<p>The next moment with a laugh of mingled
embarrassment and pleasure Betty
Graham put up her hand, covering her
husband's eyes.</p>

<p>"You must not look at me like that,
Anthony, or you will make me abominably
vain," she whispered. "Wait until the
girls and the receiving party appear and
then you will see what an ordinary person
the new 'Governor's Lady' is and repent
having raised humble Betty Ashton to
such an exalted position."</p>

<p>Arm in arm the husband and wife now
moved toward the drawing room.</p>

<p>"How little we ever dreamed of this
grandeur, dear, in the days when I had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
to work so hard to persuade you to marry
me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps if I had known I never
should have dared," Betty went on, still
half in earnest. "But I mean to do the
best I can to help in our new position,
although I must confess I am dreadfully
frightened at having to receive so many
distinguished people tonight. However,
nurse says Tony is really better. And I
shall have you to tell me what I ought
to say and do."</p>

<p>Now under the tall crystal chandelier
the young Governor lifted his wife's hand
to his lips with a smile at her absurdity.
In spite of his ordinary origin Anthony
Graham had a curious courtliness of manner.
It was amusing to hear Betty talking
of being afraid of people. All her life
she had had unusual social charm, winning
friends and admiration in every circle of
society almost from her babyhood. Naturally
in the years since her marriage,
during her husband's struggle from the
position of a successful young lawyer in
a small town to the highest office in the
state, both her charm and self-possession
had increased. Indeed, it was well known<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
that she had been her husband's chief
inspiration and aid, and there were many
persons who declared that it had been the
wife's beauty and money that were responsible
for the husband's success. However,
this remark was made by the Governor's
political enemies and not his friends and
was of course untrue.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Anthony did look somewhat
boyish and insignificant tonight for his
distinguished position. He was of only
medium height, and although his shoulders
were broad, he had never lost the thinness
of his boyhood due to hardships and too
severe study. Yet there was nothing weak
or immature about his face with its deep-set
hazel eyes, the high, grave forehead
with the dark hair pushed carelessly back,
and the firm, almost obstinate, set of his
lips.</p>

<p>Indeed, the young Governor already had
gained a reputation for obstinacy, and once
persuaded to a policy or an idea, was difficult
to change. This trait of character
had been partly responsible for his election
to office. For there had been serious
graft and dishonesty in the politics of New<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Hampshire, and led by Anthony Graham
the younger men in the state had been
able to defeat the old-time political ring.
Whether or not the good government party
would be allowed to remain in power
depended largely on the new Governor.
He had promised to stop the graft and
crime in the state and to give positions to
no persons who were not fitted for them.
Of course this meant that he must have
many enemies who would do their best
to destroy his reputation. Already they
were aware that the young Governor's
one weakness was his devotion to his
beautiful wife.</p>

<p>But Betty used often to be amused at
the outside world's opinion of her husband's
character. For never once in their
married life so far had he ever refused
any request of hers. Therefore the real
test was yet to come.</p>

<p>Five minutes later and there was once
more the sound of movement and laughter
on the stairway when the re-opening
of the drawing room door admitted
six persons, who were to form the first
members of the receiving line.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>First came Doctor and Mrs. Richard
Ashton. Already Dick had made a reputation
for himself as a surgeon in Boston,
while Esther was one of the plain girls
who so frequently grow handsomer as
they grow older. Her tallness and pallor
with her abundant red hair and sweet
yet reserved manner formed tonight as
striking a contrast to her sister's grace
and animation as it had in the days when
they first learned to know of the closeness
of the tie between them.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. William Webster had
come all the way from Woodford to Concord,
leaving three babies at home, to
assist their old friends at the Inaugural
Ball. You must have guessed that Mollie
O'Neill, as Mrs. William Webster, would
have grown plumper and prettier during
the busy, happy years of married life with
her husband and children on their large
farm. For Mollie now had a small daughter
"Polly," named for her beloved twin sister,
and a pair of twin sons, Dan and Billy.
She was more than ever in love with her
husband and, many people believed, entirely
under his thumb. Yet there were times<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
when Mollie could and would assert herself
in a surprising fashion just as she had in
former days with her girl friends.</p>

<p>Tonight she was wearing a white silk
which looked just the least bit countrified
and yet was singularly becoming to Mollie's
milk-white skin, pink cheeks and shining
black hair. Yet in spite of never having
changed his occupation of farmer, there
was little to suggest the countryside in
Billy Webster's appearance, except in his
unusual strength and size. For he had
fulfilled the prediction made to Polly
O'Neill over a Camp Fire luncheon many
years before. He had remained a farmer
and a highly successful one and yet had
seen a good deal of the world and understood
many things besides farming.</p>

<p>Of the three Sunrise Hill Camp Fire
girls who had within the last few moments
joined Betty and her husband, the third
was the most changed. For is it not difficult
to imagine Meg Everett transformed
into a fashionable society woman, Meg,
whose hair never would stay neatly braided,
whose waist and skirt so frequently failed
to connect?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>However, after a number of love affairs,
to her friends' surprise Meg had married
a man as unlike her in taste and disposition
as one could well imagine. He was
a worldly, fashionable man, supposed to
be wealthy. Anyhow, he and Meg lived
in a handsome house, owned a motor car
and entertained a great deal. They had
no children, and perhaps this was the
reason why Meg did not look altogether
happy. Sometimes her old friends had
wondered if there could be other reasons,
for Meg had always been a warm-hearted,
impetuous girl, careless of fashions and
indifferent to conventions, and now she
was always dressed in clothes of the latest
design and at least appeared like a fashionable
woman.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Meg had always been more
easily influenced than any other of the
Camp Fire girls, hating to oppose the
wishes of any one near to her heart. Her
husband, Jack Emmet, was an intimate
friend of her adored brother John. He
and Meg made an attractive couple, for
although Mr. Emmet was not handsome, he
was tall and had a slender, correct figure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and sharply cut features with light blue eyes
and brown hair. Meg's costume was quite
as beautiful as Betty's, a soft rose silk and
chiffon, and her golden hair was fastened
with a small rope of pearls.</p>

<p>"You are as lovely tonight as ever,
Betty, and I know Anthony is proud of
you," Meg whispered, holding her friend's
hand for an instant. "Remember when
you once believed that Anthony was falling
in love with me? Silly child, he never
thought of any one except you! But then
he and I have always been special friends
since he believed I helped him win you.
I want to tell him how proud I feel of you
both tonight."</p>

<p>As Meg moved away, Mollie's plump
arm, which was only partly concealed by
her glove, slipped inside her hostess's.</p>

<p>"It is nice we can have a few moments
to ourselves before the ball begins," she
remarked shyly, glancing toward her husband,
who was for the moment talking
with Jack Emmet. The two men did not
like each other, but had been forced into
conversation by Meg's moving off with
Anthony.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Betty kissed her friend, quite forgetting
the dignity of her position on the present
occasion.</p>

<p>"Dear old Mollie, it is good of you
to have come to help me tonight! I
know you don't like this society business.
How I wish we had Polly here
with us! She promised to come if possible,
but I had a telegram from her only
this afternoon saying that she is almost
on the other side of the continent. It
was dated Denver, I believe."</p>

<p>The same look of affectionate incomprehension
which she had often directed toward
Polly, again crossed Mollie Webster's pretty
face.</p>

<p>"It is just as impossible as ever to keep
up with Polly," she explained half complainingly.
"She has been acting through
the West all summer, but promised to come
home for a visit this autumn. Now she
writes she won't be here for some time.
Dear me, I do wish that Polly would marry
and settle down. Of course I know it is
wonderful for her to have become such
a distinguished actress, but I never think
she is very happy and I am always worrying
over her."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Betty laughed and then looked serious.
"Polly never will settle down, as you
mean it, Mollie dear, even if she should
marry," she argued, forgetting for the
moment the other friends close about her
and the evening's ordeal. For her thoughts
had traveled away to Polly O'Neill, who
was to her surprise still Polly O'Neill.
For at one time she had certainly believed
that Polly had intended marrying Richard
Hunt, the actor, and just why their engagement
had been broken no one had ever
been told. Possibly it was because Polly
had wished to devote herself entirely to
her work. She had always said as a girl
that marriage should never be allowed to
interfere with her career, and certainly
it had not. For the Polly who had made
her first success some ten years before in
the little Irish play was now one of the
best known actresses in the United States.
Indeed, she had succeeded to the position
once held by Margaret Adams, since Margaret
Adams had married and retired.</p>

<p>However, for the present there was no
further opportunity for mutual confidences,
since in the interval Faith Barton had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
appeared and with her the Governor's new
secretary, besides a dozen other persons,
most of them political friends, who were
to assist in opening the Inaugural Ball.</p>

<p>As Anthony joined her, Betty felt her
cheeks flush and her knees tremble for an
instant. Moving toward them, accompanied
by his wife, was the man whom
Anthony had defeated in the election for
Governor. To save her life Betty could
not help recalling at this instant all the
hateful things this man had previously
said against her husband. Yet she must
not be childish, nor show ill feeling. Ex-Governor
Peyton and his wife were much
older than she and Anthony, and besides
they were their guests.</p>

<p>Betty's manner was perfectly gracious
and collected by the time the visitors
reached them.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'><span class="smcap">Idle Suspicion</span><br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>SHE had sat huddled up in a chair
outside the baby's room for several
hours. Her self-sacrifice had been
entirely unnecessary, as half a dozen persons
had assured her, but Angel was by
no means certain that she was not happier
in her present position than if she had
been down-stairs in the crowded ballroom
unnoticed and perhaps in the way
of the few people who would try to be
kind to her.</div>

<p>Two or three times she had stolen in
to look at Tony. He was sleeping quietly
and peacefully, a big beautiful baby with
Betty's soft auburn hair and Anthony's
hazel eyes. But now a clock somewhere
was striking twelve and Angel decided
that she must have a look at the guests
before they went away. She had put on
the white frock of soft chiffon and lace
that Betty had given her, but somehow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
it only made her look more childish
and insignificant. Her face was pale
now with weariness and her hair and
eyes seemed so dark in comparison as
to give her a kind of uncanny appearance.
Perhaps waiting to gain more courage
and perhaps for other reasons, immediately
after leaving the nursery Angel,
before starting down-stairs, went into another
big room at the end of the hall.</p>

<p>As the girl leaned over to gaze at a little
sleeper a small hand reached up and touched
her face. It was that of Bettina, the
"little Princess" as everybody called her.
Nevertheless Bettina was not in the least
like her mother. She had long hair that
was gold in some lights and in others a
pale brown, and her eyes were bluer than
gray. Indeed, Polly had once said of her
two or three years before, that Tina's eyes
had no color like other people's, for they
merely reflected the lights above them like
a clear pool. The little girl was slender and
quiet and many persons believed her shy,
which was not altogether true. Possibly
the oddest of her characteristics was her
ability to understand what other people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
were thinking and feeling without being
told.</p>

<p>Now she whispered: "Why don't you
just find a place where you can see, Angel,
without any one's seeing you? I shall
want you to tell me everything tomorrow.
Mother won't understand in the way I
mean."</p>

<p>Of course that was just what she should
have been doing for these past two hours,
Angelique thought to herself as soon after
she slipped away. But it was like Bettina
to have suggested it. Already she knew
the exact place where she might have
been in hiding all this time.</p>

<p>On the second floor toward the rear of
the house there was a kind of square landing
which faced a small room that was
oddly separated from the other apartments.
For this reason the Governor had chosen
it for his private study. Only one servant
was allowed to enter this room and very
rarely any member of the family. For in
it were kept a number of important letters
and papers.</p>

<p>But concealing the entrance tonight were
a number of palms and other tall plants,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and by placing a small camp chair behind
them one could see through the railing
of the balustrade down into the big hall.
The music was there and many beautifully
dressed people were walking up and
down.</p>

<p>The little French girl stared for ten
minutes without moving. She had a
curious, almost passionate love of beautiful
people and things, inherited from some
far-off French ancestor, who may have
been a great artist or perchance only carried
a great artist's longings in his soul.
Indeed, Angel had real talent of her own
and whatever her hands touched she
could make lovely, whether it was designing
a dress, decorating a room or even
making a sketch of a scene or a flower,
anything that had appealed to her imagination.
Through her Camp Fire training
she had learned to make remarkable
use of her hands, especially in the days before
she was able to leave her wheeled chair.
Indeed, Betty and all of her friends had
been disappointed when she had failed to
follow some artistic profession. Betty
had urged and pleaded with her to become<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
an artist or designer and had offered to
pay her expenses, yet as soon as she was
well enough Angel had insisted upon studying
something through which she could
at once make her living. By this time
the little French girl had been brought
too close to life's realities not to understand
its difficulties. To make her living
as an artist or a designer would take years
and years of study and work before she
could hope to succeed. Besides, Betty,
in spite of Judge Maynard's legacy, was
not so rich as she was generous and there
were always other people to be thought of.
For the Princess had never ceased her
generosities, and even if her husband had
become a distinguished man it would be
difficult for him ever to be a rich one
unless something unforeseen happened.
Therefore Angel had been happy enough
with her stenography and typewriting and
with her new position in the Governor's
office. For in her heart of hearts it was
her philosophy that duty could be done
every day and beauty kept for certain
exquisite moments.</p>

<p>Now, however, she felt that one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
these perfect moments had come. Only
she wished that Betty or some one whom
she knew might appear within her range
of vision. It was entertaining, of course,
to watch the strangers and to decide whose
clothes were prettiest and guess their
names.</p>

<p>Angel drew her chair farther away from
the landing so she could peep squarely
through the banisters and was now some
distance from the study door. Moreover,
the following moment she had caught a
glimpse of a friend whom she had wished
to see almost as much as Betty. There
stood a tall girl with pale gold hair, wearing
a frock of white and blue, and talking
to a young man in as absorbed a fashion as
if they had been entirely alone. It was
difficult to see her companion and yet the
French girl felt that she might have guessed
before she finally discovered him. For
Faith's face wore the same rapt, excited
expression it had worn that afternoon on
returning from her walk. What could it
mean? Angel pondered. Surely Faith
and Kenneth Helm did not yet know
each other well enough for Faith's secret<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
to have anything to do with him. Their
acquaintance had started only about ten
days before.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 302px;"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>
<img src="images/i039.png" width="302" height="500" alt="He Glanced Quickly About Him and Then Disappeared" title="" />
<span class="caption">He Glanced Quickly About Him and Then Disappeared</span>
</div>

<p>Surely in her absorbed interest Angelique
had no thought of spying on her friend,
for two people could not be seriously confidential
when hundreds of others were
close about them. Nevertheless the watcher
felt her own cheeks flush guiltily as she
saw the young man below her whispering
something in his companion's ear. The
next instant, however, Faith had left the
hall with some one else. Then to her
intense consternation Angel observed Kenneth
Helm coming alone straight up the
broad stairs. Could it be possible that
either one of them had seen her and
that Faith was sending Kenneth to bring
her down to the ballroom? With all
her heart Angel hoped not. She would
like to have gotten up and run away to
shelter, yet knew it was impossible for her
to move without making a noise. By
remaining silent there was just a chance
that Kenneth Helm was on his way to
the men's dressing room and would not
notice her. Moreover, if Faith had not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
sent him to find her probably he would
not even speak to her.</p>

<p>It was quite true that the girl in hiding
need have felt no concern. The young
man certainly did not see her, nor did he
pass her by. For some odd reason he
stopped for a moment at the top of the
landing, glanced quickly about him and
then disappeared inside the Governor's
private study, opening the door with a
key which must have been given him for
the especial purpose.</p>

<p>"What could Kenneth wish in there
tonight?" Angelique wondered idly, somewhat
relieved because his errand plainly
had nothing to do with her. Moreover,
there was too much that was absorbing
below stairs to give a great deal of thought
to anything else just at present.</p>

<p>The next instant Angel started, uttering
a little gasp of anger and dismay, as
a hand was laid rudely upon her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Whom are you spying upon now, 'Angel
in the House?'" the young man's voice
asked mockingly. "Don't you think that
perhaps you are rather an uncanny person
anyhow?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl flushed and found it impossible
to keep her lips from trembling. When
she had first gone to work in Anthony
Graham's office, Kenneth Helm had also
been employed there and had been unusually
kind to her. Recently, however,
he seemed to have avoided and almost
to have disliked her. This she knew had
caused a change in her own attitude,
so perhaps her prejudice against the young
man's position as the Governor's private
secretary was largely due to this. Nevertheless
she had done nothing to deserve
the change in his treatment of her, and
if a human being is disloyal to one
friendship, why not to another?</p>

<p>However, at the present moment the
girl only wished to be left alone, so she
merely shook her head, explaining: "I
didn't mean to be spying upon any one,
and I am sorry if you think I am uncanny."
Then she glanced pathetically down toward
the cane at her side, and this time her
companion blushed.</p>

<p>"Oh, I did not mean that, Miss Martins.
That is not fair of you," he remonstrated.
"But please don't mention to the Governor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
or any one that you saw me go into his
private study tonight, will you? You see,
I had forgotten something that I ought
to have attended to at the office. My
memory is not so good as yours. Won't
you let me take you down-stairs?"</p>

<p>The lame girl rose slowly, not knowing
exactly how to refuse the young man's
offer. Besides, she remembered what Betty
had said to her. "She must not be so suspicious
and prejudiced against people."</p>

<p>"Certainly I won't speak to Mr. Graham
of your having gone into his office. Why
should I?" she conceded, laying her hand
lightly on her companion's arm. "Besides,
do you think I talk to the Governor
about his affairs just because I live in his
house? He is so quiet and stern I am
dreadfully afraid of him. It is Betty,
Mrs. Graham, who is my friend. If it is
not too much trouble to you and she is
not too busy I would like to have you
take me to her now for a little while.
Never in my life have I seen anything so
splendid as this reception tonight!"</p>

<p>When the little French girl talked she
was not half so homely and unattractive,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Kenneth Helm decided as he made his
way with her through the crowd. Moreover,
he must not turn her into an enemy,
for assuredly Mrs. Graham was her devoted
friend and what his wife desired was law
with the Governor.</p>

<p>Kenneth Helm intended to succeed in
life. This was the keynote of his character.
He wanted money and power and
meant to do anything necessary to attain
them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'><span class="smcap">Ties from Other Days</span><br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>ONE morning, a few days later, Mrs.
Jack Emmet was ushered into
Betty's personal sitting room.
Betty was writing notes and Bettina was
curled up in a big chair near the window
with a book of fairy tales in her lap.</div>

<p>Both of them rose at once, Betty
kissing her friend affectionately. But her
little girl, who showed her affection differently
from other children, sitting down
by Meg's side, slipped her small hand inside
hers.</p>

<p>Meg was beautifully dressed in a dark
blue broadcloth and black fox furs with a
velvet hat and small black feather curled
close against her light hair. Yet the hat
was the least bit awry, one lock of hair
had come uncurled and been blown about
by the wind, and a single blue button hung
loose on the stylish coat. Noticing these
absurd details for some reason or other,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Betty felt oddly pleased. For they
brought back the Meg of old days, whom
not all the strenuous years of Camp Fire
training had been able to make as neat
as she should have been, although since
her marriage she seemed to have greatly
changed.</p>

<p>Therefore, in observing these unimportant
facts of her friend's costume Betty
failed to catch the difference in her
expression. They began their conversation
idly enough in discussing the ball of a few
nights before, the Governor's health and
just how busy he was and what people
were saying of him in Concord. For,
although Mr. and Mrs. Graham had only
been installed in the Governor's mansion
a few weeks, Mr. and Mrs. Jack Emmet
had been living in Concord ever since
their marriage about five years before.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if Betty had not observed
the change in her friend, in some unaccountable
fashion Bettina had. Not that the
little girl realized that Mrs. Emmet had
dark circles under her eyes and that instead
of gazing directly at her mother as she
talked, her glance traveled restlessly about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the pretty room. Nor did Bettina know
that Meg's cheeks were not a natural pink,
but flushed to uncomfortable redness; no,
she only appreciated that "Aunt Meg,"
for whom she cared a great deal, was uneasy
and unhappy and would perhaps enjoy
having her keep close beside her.</p>

<p>"You will stay and take lunch with us,
won't you, dear?" Betty urged, moving
forward to assist her visitor in removing
her wraps. "You see, we shall probably
be all by ourselves. Anthony is too busy
to come home, Angel is at the office and
Faith asked to be left alone for the day.
The child is probably scribbling away on
some story she desires to write. Then after
lunch we can see little Tony. The baby is
well again, only the nurse wants him kept
quiet."</p>

<p>Affectionately Betty placed her hands on
Meg's shoulders and standing directly beside
her now for the first time looked closely
into her face. To her shocked surprise she
discovered that unexpected tears had started
to Meg's eyes.</p>

<p>At once Betty Graham's happy expression
clouded. For she was no less ready<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
with her sympathy than in former days,
and the Camp Fire girls of the old Sunrise
Club seemed almost like real sisters.</p>

<p>"You came to tell me of something that
is troubling you and I didn't dream of it till
this minute!" Betty exclaimed, slipping off
Meg's coat and unpinning her hat without
waiting for permission. Then, pushing
her friend down into a big, soft armchair,
she took a lower one opposite.</p>

<p>"Isn't it good fortune that we are living
in the same place just as we used to long
ago?" She continued talking, of course,
to allow her companion to gain her self-control.
Then she glanced toward Bettina,
but Meg only drew the little girl closer,
hiding her face for an instant in her soft
hair.</p>

<p>"I'm absurd to be so nervous, Betty,"
Meg whispered apologetically. "Please
don't think there is anything serious the
matter. Only&mdash;only I have come to ask
you a favor and I don't know exactly how
to begin. Of course, we used to be very
intimate friends and all that, but now you
are the Governor's wife, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Before she could finish a somewhat hurt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
voice interposed. "And&mdash;and&mdash;I am Betty
Ashton Graham still, very much at your
service, Sweet Marjoram, as Polly once
named you. Dear me, Meg, don't be
absurd. I can't say I feel particularly
exalted by my position as wife of the new
Governor, though of course I am frightfully
vain of Anthony. Besides you know if there
is anything I can do that you would like,
I shall be happier than I can say." With
a laugh that still had something serious
in it, Betty put her hand over her friend's.
"I still insist that I owe Anthony partly
to you," she ended.</p>

<p>But this time Meg did not trouble to
argue the absurd statement.</p>

<p>She began talking at once as rapidly as
possible, as if glad to get the subject off her
mind.</p>

<p>"It's about John, I came to talk to you,
my brother, John Everett, Betty," Meg
explained. "I don't know whether you
have seen much of him lately, but you were
devoted friends once and I thought perhaps
for the sake of the past you might be interested."</p>

<p>"John Everett? For the sake of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
past I might be interested! Whatever are
you talking about?" Betty was now frowning
in her effort to understand and looked
absurdly like a girl, with her level brows
drawn near together and her lips pouting
slightly. "Why, of course I am interested.
I used to like John better than any of the
other beaus we had, when we were girls,
except Anthony. Tell me, is John going to
be married at last? I have wondered why
he has waited such a long time. But I suppose
he wanted to be rich first. It has been
about two years since we met by accident
in a theater in New York, but I thought he
had grown handsomer than ever." This
time Betty's laugh was more teasing than
sympathetic. "I wonder why sisters are
so jealous of their big brothers marrying,
Mrs. Jack Emmet? You are married yourself&mdash;why
begrudge John the good fortune?
I don't believe Nan has ever entirely forgiven
me for capturing Anthony. I am convinced
she would have preferred any other of the
Camp Fire girls. There is only one of us,
however, whom she would have really liked,
and that is Sylvia. Yet who would ever
think of Doctor Sylvia Wharton's marrying?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>This time Meg's voice was firmer. "But
John isn't going to be married, Betty. It
is quite a different thing I wish to talk to
you about. Instead of John's getting rich
on Wall Street, as you think, he has gotten
dreadfully poor. And I am afraid it is not
just his own money he has lost, but father's
savings. Now Horace will have to give
up his college and I really don't know what
will become of father. He is too old to
begin teaching again since his resignation
several years ago."</p>

<p>Her voice broke, but then her friend's
face was so bewildered and so full of a
sudden, ardent sympathy, that it was
difficult for Meg to keep her self-control.
However, she said nothing more for a
minute, but sat biting her lips and wondering
how to go on to the next thing.</p>

<p>Fortunately Betty helped her. "I expect
John will have to come back home and
take care of your father. Horace is too
young and it is more John's place than
your husband's. I am sorry, for I'm afraid
things will seem pretty dull for him here
after his gay life in New York."</p>

<p>All at once Betty's face cleared a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and she leaned back in her chair. "But you
remember, Meg, that when you first spoke
you said you wished me to do you a favor.
Is there anything in the world I can do?
I am sure I can scarcely imagine what it is,
yet if I can in any way help you out of this
trouble&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can," Meg whispered shyly; "that
is, perhaps not you, but Anthony, and you
are almost the same person."</p>

<p>In answer to this rather surprising statement
Betty Graham merely shook her head
quietly. However, this was scarcely the
time to argue whether or not marriage
merged two persons into one or simply
made each one bigger and more individual
from association with the other. She
wanted to do whatever was possible to
assist Meg and John Everett too in this
trying time in their affairs. Besides, as a
little girl she had always been fond of old
Professor Everett, whose life had been
given to the wisdom of books rather than
to the living world. But most of all, being
a very natural woman, Betty was now
keenly curious to know how she could
possibly be expected to be involved in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
present situation and what she could do to
help out.</p>

<p>"You are right. John does mean to
come home, or at least he wishes to return.
He says he is tired of New York and all
the fret and hurry and struggle of life there.
But you see, Betty dear," and Meg spoke
quickly now that she had finally come to the
point of her story, "there is no use John's
returning unless he has something to do.
There is where you and Anthony can help.
I didn't think of this myself, but when
my husband and I were talking things over
he said that Anthony and you and I were
such old friends and that the new Governor
had so many appointments he could make
to all sorts of good positions. So we thought
perhaps you would ask Anthony to help
John. I know Anthony does anything
you wish."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Betty replied somewhat blankly.
For never had she been more surprised
than by Meg's request. Of course she
knew that Anthony was making a number
of changes in positions held by people
whom he thought unworthy of trust
throughout the state. Often he talked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
about what he felt he should do, but really
it had never dawned upon Betty until this
minute that she or her friends could be in
any way concerned. Still, why not? John
was a good business man, Betty thought; he
was not dishonest or dishonorable and the
Everetts were her old friends. If Anthony
could help them in their present trouble,
surely he would be as glad as she was to
have the opportunity.</p>

<p>Yet Betty hesitated before answering.
However, as she did not wish to make Meg
uncomfortable she slipped from her own
chair and put her arm sympathetically
about her friend's shoulders, while she
endeavored to think things quietly over.
Finally Betty returned:</p>

<p>"I can't <i>exactly</i> promise what you first
asked, Meg dear. You see, I have always
intended not to interfere in the things that
did not seem altogether my affair. But
somehow, since you have asked me and
for John's and your father's sakes, who are
such old friends, why I don't feel as I did
before. I tell you, I <i>will</i> ask Anthony this
very night, so let's don't worry any more.
Tina darling, run and tell the maids we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
would like our luncheon up here. Our
dining room is so absurdly big."</p>

<p>As she talked, as if by magic Betty's
expression had changed and again she was
her usual gay, light-hearted self. Of course
she and Anthony together would be able
to clear away Meg's troubles. Never
before had she entirely realized how fine
it was to have power and influence.</p>

<p>Moreover, Betty's confidence also inspired
Meg, and for the first time in weeks Mrs.
Jack Emmet felt like the Meg Everett of
the old days in Woodford, who used to keep
house for her father, kiss her small brother
Horace's (surnamed Bump's) wounds and
help and encourage her big brother John
in all his ambitions and desires.</p>

<p>Just as Meg went away, however, she
insisted quite seriously:</p>

<p>"Betty, I often think that even if our
old Camp Fire Club did nothing more for
us than to bind our friendships together
in the way it has, it would be dreadful for
all girls not to have the same opportunities
in their lives. Talk of college friendships,
surely they are not to be compared with
those of Camp Fire clubs!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'><span class="smcap">Something Unexpected</span><br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>DINNER was tiresomely dull! Again
Anthony did not return, but telephoned
that he would be in as
soon afterwards as possible. Several times
during the meal Betty almost wished that
she had accepted an invitation for the
evening without him. For they had been
invited to a dinner party and dance, but as
Anthony had declared he would be too busy
to attend, Betty had declined without any
objection at the time. She had made up
her mind never to go out into society unless
accompanied by her husband.</div>

<p>Nevertheless, tonight the young wife of
the new Governor felt somewhat differently.
If Anthony was going everlastingly to be
kept at his office must she always sit alone
during the evenings? Always as Betty
Ashton she had loved people and gayety
and still loved it quite as much as Betty
Graham. Moreover, her only two companions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
at dinner, Angel and Faith, were
both in extremely bad humor and unwilling
to confess the cause, for Faith looked sulky
and annoyed and Angel undeniably cross.
Of course, the two girls must recently have
had a quarrel. Their hostess wondered
for a few moments what the trouble could
have been. But then they were so utterly
different in their dispositions and tastes,
it was not surprising that they sometimes
disagreed. Besides, she decided that they
were both unlike the intimate friends of her
youth and far harder to understand. In
fact, though she was scarcely much more
than a girl herself, Mrs. Graham concluded
that "girls had changed since her day"
and determined as soon as dinner was over
to leave them to themselves. Naturally,
if they had wished her society Betty would
have been glad enough to have remained
and received their confidences. However,
neither Angel nor Faith showed the slightest
sign of desiring her society.</p>

<p>In a pale blue silk dinner gown Betty
wandered disconsolately about her big house
waiting for her husband. He had promised
to come home early and it seemed not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
worth while to settle down to any task
beforehand. The babies were asleep and
she did not feel like writing letters either
to Esther or her mother. Several times
she thought of Polly. But Polly was so
far away out West that she really did not
know where to find her at the present time.
Betty wondered if her best friend was
happy with no home or husband or children,
nothing intimate in her life but her career
as an artist. She had always been puzzled
to understand why Polly and Richard Hunt
had never married after an engagement
lasting over several years. But since
neither of them had cared to explain their
separation, it was, of course, useless to
conjecture again after all this time.</p>

<p>The drawing room was too hopelessly
big and formal! After Betty had walked
around inside it for half an hour perhaps,
sitting down in half a dozen chairs and
then pacing up and down, she grew even
more restless. Surely it was no longer early
in the evening, and why did Anthony not
keep his word and come home at the time
he had promised? It would be ever so
much more satisfactory to have her talk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
with him in regard to giving John Everett
a good position, with a comfortable salary,
early in the evening, before they were both
tired and wanting to sleep.</p>

<p>Suddenly, with an impatient stamp of
her foot, Mrs. Graham fled from her state
apartment. She was homesick tonight for
her old home in Woodford, where she and
Anthony had lived ever since their marriage
until his election as Governor, and where
her mother still lived.</p>

<p>Passing through the hall, more and more
did Betty become convinced that Anthony
was not keeping his word, for the tall clock
registered quarter to ten. The upper part
of the house looked dark and quiet as
if the rest of the family had already gone
to bed. Besides it was lonely enough on
the first floor, for the servants had their
sitting room and dining room in a big old-fashioned
basement and were nowhere to
be seen. Of course, one of them would
come at once if she desired anything, but
Betty could not think of anything she
wished at present except society and amusement.</p>

<p>In the library back of the drawing room<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
a few moments later she decided that things
were not so bad. There was a little wood
fire in the grate, kept there for its cheerful
influence and not because the steam-heated
house required it; but Betty had not been
a Camp Fire girl for half her lifetime
without responding to the cheerful influence
of even a grate fire.</p>

<p>Sinking down into a comfortable chair,
she picked up a magazine and began reading.
The clock in the hall ticked on and
on and she was not conscious of the passing
of time. The story was not particularly
interesting&mdash;an absurd tale of a husband
and wife who had quarreled. It was, of
course, perfectly unnecessary for people
who loved each other to quarrel, Betty
Graham insisted to herself, and yet the
writer did not seem convinced of this fact.
Toward the close of the story she grew more
interested and excited.</p>

<p>Then, without actually hearing a sound
or seeing a figure, Betty suddenly looked
up, and there in the open doorway of the
library stood a strange man. Like a flash
her mind worked. She was alone on the
first floor of a big, rambling old house and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
uncertain of how late the hour. Must she
at once cry for help, or should she try to get
across the floor and ring the bell furiously?&mdash;for
that would be more certain to be heard.
Yet for the moment her knees felt absurdly
weak and her hands cold. However, with
a stupendous effort Betty now summoned
her courage, of which the shock of the moment
had robbed her. For her Camp Fire
training had taught her the proper spirit
in which to meet emergencies. Quietly
Mrs. Graham rose up from her chair.</p>

<p>"What is it you wish? I think you have
made some mistake," she remarked stiffly.
For in spite of her terror the man in the
doorway did not look like an ordinary
thief. Besides, if he were a thief why did
he remain there staring at her? Why had
he not committed his burglary and gotten
away with his spoils without alarming her?</p>

<p>But he was now advancing a few steps
toward her and there was no light in the
library, except from the reading lamp.</p>

<p>"Anthony!" Betty cried instinctively,
although she knew that the Governor could
not be in the house at the time, else he
would have come straight to her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Then to her immense amazement, almost
to her stupefaction, the intruder actually
smiled.</p>

<p>"Betty," he answered, "or rather Mrs.
Graham, have I startled you? Yes, I know
it is dreadfully informal, my coming upon
you in this fashion and not even allowing
your butler to announce me. But I ran
down from New York today to spend the
night with Meg and Jack Emmet. A few
moments ago we began talking of you.
Well, as I've got to go back to town in the
morning I decided that nothing would give
me more pleasure than seeing the wife of
our distinguished new Governor, so here
I am!"</p>

<p>Positively the stranger was holding out
his hand.</p>

<p>Moreover, the next instant Betty had
laid her cold fingers inside it.</p>

<p>"John, John Everett, how ridiculous of
me not to have recognized you! Yet,
though I was thinking of you, you were the
last person in the world I expected to see
at present. And I confess you frightened
me." Betty made her visitor a little
curtsey. "Remember how you boys used<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
to try to terrify us when we were in camp
just to prove the superiority of Boy Scouts
over Camp Fire girls? I would not have
been frightened then! But do let us have
more light so that we can really see each
other."</p>

<p>Betty touched the electric button and
the room was suddenly aglow.</p>

<p>Then she again faced her companion.
It had been foolish of her not to have
recognized her old friend, John Everett.
He did look a good deal older, but he was
a large, handsome man with blond hair,
blue eyes and a charming manner. Moreover,
he was undoubtedly returning Betty's
glance with undisguised admiration.</p>

<p>"You won't mind my saying it, will you,
Mrs. Graham, but you are more stunning
than ever. I suppose it sounds a little
impertinent of me, but you know even
though I always thought you tremendously
pretty as a girl, really I never believed&mdash;&mdash;"
John began.</p>

<p>Betty shook her head reproachfully and
yet perhaps she was a little pleased, even
though she recognized her visitor's compliment
as extravagant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>Motioning to another chair, she then sat
down in her former one. For a few moments
there was a kind of constraint in the atmosphere,
such as one often feels in meeting
again an old friend with whom one has
been intimate in former years and not
seen in a long time.</p>

<p>Under her lashes Betty found herself
studying her visitor's face. At first she
did not think that he appeared much discouraged
by his misfortunes, but the next
moment she was not so sure.</p>

<p>"I am awfully pleased the world has gone
so well with you, Mrs. Graham," John
Everett began, to cover the awkwardness of
the silence. "You were a wise girl to have
known that Anthony had so much more in
him than the rest of us fellows. I hear he
is making things hum in the state of New
Hampshire."</p>

<p>Betty looked a little shocked. "Oh, I
did not care for Anthony because I thought
him cleverer than other people. I&mdash;oh,
does one ever know exactly why one cares?
But do tell me about yourself, John. You
don't mind my knowing of your present
difficulty? Meg has just told me, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
I am sure things will be all right soon
again."</p>

<p>Half an hour later the young Governor,
coming in very tired from his long day's
work, seeing the light burning in the
library, walked quickly toward the door.
He was worn out and hungry and wanted
nothing so much as supper and quiet talk
with his wife. For Anthony had never
gotten over the pleasure he felt at returning
home to find her there to receive him.
Already it seemed ages since he had said
good-bye at breakfast.</p>

<p>However, just before he arrived at the
open door he heard the sound of Betty's
laughter and some one answering her.</p>

<p>Of course it was selfish and absurd of
him to feel a sudden sense of disappointment.
He knew that he should have been
glad to find Betty entertained.</p>

<p>Before entering the library the new
Governor managed to assume a more
hospitable expression. He was also surprised
at finding John Everett their caller.
But then he too had known him in their
boyhood days in Woodford and was glad
to see him. Certainly they had never been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
friends as boys. The young Governor
could still remember that John had then
seemed to have all the things he had wanted
as a boy&mdash;good looks, good family, money
enough for a college education. Yet with
all these advantages John had not been able
to win Betty. Now was Anthony's chance
to feel sorry for him. Lately he too had
heard that John Everett was in some kind
of business trouble. He hoped that this
was not true.</p>

<p>Therefore it was Anthony who insisted
that their visitor should remain with them
while they had a little supper party in the
library. And Betty was glad to see that
her old friend was making a good impression
upon her husband. For she was now firmly
determined to ask Anthony to give John
Everett a fine position at once.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'><span class="smcap">The First Disillusion</span><br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>"BUT you can't mean, Anthony,
that you positively refuse to do
what I ask?"</div>

<p>It was a little after midnight and Betty
and Anthony were up-stairs in their own
apartment. Betty had on a blue dressing
gown and her hair was braided and hung
over her shoulders. But her cheeks were
flushed, her gray eyes dark with temper
and her voice trembled in spite of her effort
to keep it still.</p>

<p>Undeniably Anthony appeared both obstinate
and worried. Moreover, he was
extremely sleepy and yet somehow Betty
must be made to understand before either
of them could rest. Never before had he
dreamed that she could be so unreasonable.</p>

<p>"I don't think that is exactly a fair way
of stating the thing, Betty," the young Governor
answered gently enough. "You see,
I have tried to explain to you, dear, that I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
can't give positions to friends just as though
running the affairs of the state was my private
business. I could afford to take risks
with that if I wished, but you know I promised
when I was elected Governor only to
make appointments of the best men I could
find."</p>

<p>If possible, the Governor's wife looked
even more unconvinced. She was sitting
in a big blue chair almost the color of her
wrapper, and every now and then rocked
back and forth to express her emotion, or
else tapped the floor mutinously with the
toe of her bedroom slipper.</p>

<p>"You talk as if there was something
wrong with John Everett," she answered
argumentatively, "and as if I were asking
you to give a position to a man who was
stupid or dishonest. I am perfectly sure
John is none of these things. He has been
unfortunate in business lately, of course,
but that might happen to any one. Really,
Anthony, would you mind telling me exactly
what you have in your mind against
John Everett? Of course, I remember you
never liked him when you were boys, but
I thought you were too big a man&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"See here, Betty," the Governor interrupted,
"can't we let this subject drop?
I never knew you to be like this before."
He had thrown himself down on a couch,
but now reached over and tried to take his
wife's reluctant hand. "I've been explaining
to you for the past hour that I have
nothing in the world against John Everett
personally, except that he has no training
for the kind of work I need men to do.
He has been a Wall Street broker. Well,
that is all right, but what does he know
about prison reform, about building good
roads for the state, or anything else I'm
after? Just because he is your friend&mdash;our
friend, I mean&mdash;I can't thrust him into a
good job over the heads of better men.
Please look at this as I do, Betty. I hate
desperately to refuse your request and I
know Meg will be hurt with me too and
think I'm unfaithful to old times. Heigh-ho,
I wonder if anybody thinks being
Governor is a cheerful job? Good-night,
Princess."</p>

<p>Plainly meaning to end their conversation,
Anthony had gotten up from his sofa.
He now stood above Betty, waiting to have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
her make peace with him. But Betty
looked far from peaceful, more like a
spoiled and angry little girl thwarted in a
wish which she had not imagined could be
refused.</p>

<p>Of course the Princess had always been
more or less spoiled all her life. Her friends
in the Camp Fire Club and her family had
always acknowledged this. But she was
usually reasonable with the sweetest possible
temper, so that no one really minded.
Nevertheless Betty was not accustomed to
having her serious wishes denied, and by
her husband of all people!</p>

<p>Really she would have liked very much
to cry with disappointment and vexation,
except that she was much too proud.
Moreover, even now she could not finally
accept the idea that Anthony would not
eventually do as she asked.</p>

<p>But she drew back coldly from any idea
of making friends until then.</p>

<p>"Good-night," she replied indifferently.
"I don't think I shall try to go to sleep."
Her voice trembled now in spite of all her
efforts.</p>

<p>"Really, Anthony, I don't know how I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
can tell Meg and John that you have declined
to do what I have asked you. I
wonder what they will think? Certainly
that I haven't any influence with my own
husband! Do you know, Anthony, perhaps
I am wrong, but I thought I had
helped you a little in your election. I've
made a good many sacrifices; you have
to leave me alone a greater part of the
time because you are too busy to spend
much of your time with me. Well, I have
never thought of complaining, but somehow
it does seem to me that I have the
right to have you do just this one thing I
ask of you. I'm afraid I don't find being a
Governor's wife so very cheerful either."</p>

<p>While she was talking Betty had also
gotten up and was now standing near the
doorway. As her husband came toward
her she moved slowly backward.</p>

<p>"I say, Betty dear, you are hard on a
fellow," Anthony protested. "Of course
I owe my job to you and anything else that
is good about me. But you can't want me
to do wrong even for your sake. Maybe
you may see things differently tomorrow."</p>

<p>However, instead of replying, the Governor's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
wife slipped outside the room. In
the nursery she lay down by Bettina. But
she slept very little for the rest of the night.</p>

<p>For in her opinion Anthony had not been
fair; he had not even been kind. A few
hours before, when she had assured John
and Meg of her sympathy and aid, she
could not have believed this possible. This
was the first time in their married life that
her husband had refused her anything of
importance. Surely she had been wrong
in suggesting or even thinking for half a
second that his old boyish dislike and
jealousy of John Everett could influence
Anthony now! It was an absurd idea, and
even a horrid one; and yet is one ever altogether
fair in anger?</p>

<p>Down-stairs, in spite of his fatigue, Anthony
Graham walked up and down their
big room for a quarter of an hour. If he
only could have reconciled it with his conscience
to do what Betty asked him, how
much easier and how much more cheerful
for both of them! She was right in saying
that he owed something to her. He owed
everything. It was not just that she had
helped him since his marriage&mdash;most wives<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
do that for their husbands&mdash;but she had
helped him from that first hour of their
meeting in the woods so many years before.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he had given his word to
keep his faith as Governor of the state.
He had promised to give no one a position
because of pull and influence. Naturally
he had not expected his wife to have any
part in this, but only the politicians and
seekers after graft. Yet even with Betty
misunderstanding he must try to keep his
word.</p>

<p>Sighing, the young Governor turned out
the lights. He did look too boyish and
delicate for the weight of his responsibilities
tonight. For there had been other troubles
in his office which he had wished to confide
to his wife, had she only been willing to
listen. However, he finally fell asleep
somewhat comforted. For he was convinced
that Betty was too sensible a woman not
finally to see things in the light that he did.
When he had the opportunity and she was
neither tired nor vexed with him he would
explain to her all over again.</p>

<p>An uncomfortable spirit, however, seemed
to be brooding over the Governor's mansion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
this evening, for in another part of
the big house, there was another argument
also lasting far into the night.</p>

<p>Angel and Faith sat on either side an
old-fashioned four-poster bed, often talking
at the same time in the way that
only feminine creatures can.</p>

<p>In her white cashmere kimono over her
gown, with her pale hair unbound, Faith
Barton looked like a little white saint.
But alas, and in spite of her name, the little
French girl bore no resemblance to one!</p>

<p>Angel's dark hair was extraordinarily
heavy and curly but not very long, and
now in her uneasiness she had pushed and
pulled at it until it was extremely untidy.
Moreover, her black eyes now and then
flashed resentfully at her friend and two
bright spots of color burned in her cheeks.
When she was not talking her lips were
pressed closely together.</p>

<p>"Faith, it isn't right of you; you know
it isn't. You should not have made me
promise to keep your secret before telling
me it. How could I ever have guessed
such a dreadful thing! I simply must,
must tell Betty if you are not going to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
confide in Mrs. Barton. Then Betty can
do what she thinks best and it will be
off my conscience."</p>

<p>Certainly Angelique Martins was not
speaking in an amiable tone, and yet her
companion seemed not in the slightest
disturbed.</p>

<p>Indeed, Faith began quietly brushing
her long, straight hair.</p>

<p>"Don't be a goose, Angel, and don't
have so much conscience for other people.
Of course, I am sorry I told you. Kenneth
said it would be wiser not to speak to
any one for the present, but I had to have
some confidant. Now you are trying to
spoil my first real romance by wanting
me to get up and proclaim it on the housetops.
What I like most about being
engaged to Kenneth is that no one knows
of it and that we can see each other without
a lot of silly people staring and talking
about us. Of course, when we begin to
think about being married I shall tell
Rose everything. Then I know she will
understand. But we are not going to be
married for a long, long time, I expect.
Kenneth says that nothing would persuade<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
him to marry me until he could give me
everything in the world I want. Oh,
you need not look so superior, Angel;
I understand you don't approve of that
sentiment, but I think it is beautiful for
a man to feel that way about a girl.
You simply can't appreciate Kenneth."
And Faith looked sufficiently gentle and
forgiving to have tried the patience of
a saint.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," the other girl answered
shortly. "Anyhow, Faith, you are right
in believing I don't approve of the things
you have told me. The idea of your being
secretly engaged to a man whom you have
only known about two weeks! It is horrid!
Naturally you don't either of you
know whether you are really in love;
but then I don't think you ought to be
engaged until you are willing to tell people.
Besides, what do you know about Mr.
Helm's real character, Faith? He is the
kind of fellow who makes love to almost
every girl he meets."</p>

<p>Almost under her breath and with her
cheeks flaming the little lame French girl
made this last speech. Nevertheless her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
companion heard her. Still Faith did not
appear angry as most girls would have
been under the circumstances, but perhaps
her gentle, pitying expression was harder
to endure.</p>

<p>"Is that what troubles you, Angel?
I am so sorry," Faith returned, ceasing
to brush her hair to smile compassionately
at her friend. "You see, Kenneth warned
me that you did not like him very much.
He was too kind to explain exactly the
reason, only he said that you seemed to
have misunderstood something about him.
I suppose he was kind to you once, Angel,
because of course he would be specially
kind to a girl like you. But, there, you
need not look so angry! You have a dreadful
temper, Angel. Even Betty Graham
thinks so in spite of being so fond of
you."</p>

<p>With pretended carelessness Faith Barton
now glanced away, devoting all her
energy to plaiting her long hair. Really
her speech had been more unkind than
she had intended it. But somehow she
and Angel were always having differences
of opinion and it seemed to Faith that it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
was usually Angel's fault, because she
never quarreled with any one else.</p>

<p>Besides, ever since her first meeting
with the little French girl at Sunrise Cabin
she had been the one who had tried to
make and keep their friendship. Angel
never seemed to care deeply for any one
except her mother and now Mrs. Graham
and her babies, and was always getting into
hot water with other people.</p>

<p>However, it certainly did not occur to
Faith that her own amiability came partly
from a lack of interest in any one except
herself and partly because her own whims
were so seldom interfered with.</p>

<p>Curious that Rose Barton, who had
been such a sensible guardian and friend
to her group of Camp Fire girls, had been
so indulgent to her adopted daughter!
But very few persons understood Faith
Barton. She seemed to be absolutely
gentle and loving and to live always in
a world of beautiful dreams and desires.
How could any one guess that she was
often both selfish and self-willed?</p>

<p>"There is no use talking any more on
this subject, Faith, if you think I wish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
to interfere because I am jealous of you,"
Angel declared, and finding her cane slipped
down from the bed. "Besides, you know
perfectly well you are doing wrong without
my saying it. Anyhow, I believe that
something will happen to make you sorry
enough before you are through."</p>

<p>With this parting shot Angel marched
stiffly out of the room, too proud to reveal
how deeply her friend had wounded her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'><span class="smcap">A New Interest</span><br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>IT is a far journey from the New Hampshire
hills to the plains of the West.</div>

<p>Nevertheless a girl whom we once
knew at Sunrise Hill is walking alone this
afternoon on the rim of a desert and facing
the western sun. It is scarcely fair
to call her a girl, unless one has the
theory that so long as a woman does
not marry she retains her girlhood. Yet
glancing at her as she strolled slowly
along, no one could have guessed her to
be more than twenty, though perhaps she
was a little nearer the next decade.</p>

<p>Exquisitely dressed in a long, dark green
broadcloth coat with a fur collar and
small hat, she was a little past medium
height and unusually slender. Her hair
was so black that it had an almost somber
look, and yet her eyes were vividly blue.
Just now, having wandered a good many
miles from the place where she was staying,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
she looked extremely tired and
depressed. In no possible way did she
appear to fit into her present surroundings,
for without a doubt she was a
woman of wealth and distinction. It was
self-evident in the clothes she wore, but
more so in the unconsciously proud carriage
of her head and in the lines of her face,
which was not beautiful and yet seemed to
have some curious charm more appealing
than mere beauty.</p>

<p>She stopped now for a moment to gaze
with an appreciation that was almost awe
at the beauty of the sinking sun. There
was a glory of color in the sky that was
almost fantastic; piles of white clouds
seemed to have been flung up against the
horizon like mammoth soap bubbles, tinted
with every rainbow shade. With unconscious
enthusiasm, the woman clasped
her hands together.</p>

<p>"Why," she exclaimed aloud, "I was
wondering what this scene reminded me of.
It is dear old Sunrise Hill! What would
I not give to be there in the old cabin
tonight with Betty and Mollie and the
others! But they must not know what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
has become of me until things are all
right again. Both Betty and Mollie are
too happy with their babies and husbands
to worry over the old maids in the family.
Sometimes, though, I feel that I should like
to send for Sylvia." Then the wanderer
turned and stared around her.</p>

<p>In every direction there were long waving
reaches of sand with an occasional clumping
of rocks, while growing near them were
strange varieties of the cactus plant. Some
of them had great leaves like elephants'
ears, some were small and thick with
queer, stiff hairs and excrescences, and
among them, in spite of the lateness of the
season, were occasional pink and crimson
flowers with waxen petals.</p>

<p>Behind the wayfarer there was a trail
which she must have followed from some
nearby village, yet it was growing less
and less distinct ahead, and certainly the
hour was far too late for a stranger to
be traveling alone so near a portion of the
great Colorado desert.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the young woman at this
moment turned and left her path. Walking
deliberately for a few yards she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
seated herself on a giant rock, and leaning
forward, rested her chin in her beautifully
gloved hands.</p>

<p>"So like you, Polly O'Neill, even in
your old age to have gotten yourself entirely
used up on the first walk you were allowed
to take alone!" she began aloud, giving
a half despairing, half amused shrug of
her thin shoulders. "I am not in the
least sure that I know the way back to
my hotel if it grows dark before I arrive
there, and assuredly I am too weary to
start for the present. And hungry! Heaven
only knows when I was ever so ravenous!
Now if I had only been a Camp Fire girl
in the West instead of the East, doubtless
I could at once discover all sorts of delectable
bread fruit and berries growing
nearby. But I don't feel I want to run
any further risks at present."</p>

<p>So for the next half hour in almost
perfect quiet Polly O'Neill remained seated.
It would have been impossible for her
to have done otherwise, for suddenly a
curious attack of exhaustion had swept
over her. It was not unusual of late,
for indeed Miss O'Neill and her maid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
had established themselves in a small
hotel near Colorado Springs in order that
the well-known actress might recover from
an attack of nervous exhaustion which
she had suffered during her successful tour
in the Western states. So Polly was quite
accustomed to finding herself all at once
too weary either to move or speak. But
quite like the Polly of old she had just
deliberately walked five miles without reflecting
on her lack of strength or the
fact that she must return by as long a
road as she had come.</p>

<p>No, in spite of the fact that Polly
O'Neill had in the last ten years made
a great name for herself as one of the
leading actresses in the United States,
she was as thoughtless and impetuous as
she had been as a girl.</p>

<p>Finally, however, with what seemed to
require a good deal of effort she got up
and moved, this time toward the east,
but all the elasticity had gone from her.
The sand was uncomfortably heavy, so
that she dragged one foot after the other
and her slender body seemed to wave like
a stalk in the wind. But the worst of her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
difficulty was that her breath came in
short, painful gasps. Unconsciously the
effort which the business of walking
required made Polly pay less strict attention
to the path which she should have
followed. But by and by, realizing that
her way was less plain and that it was
now quite dusk, she paused for a moment,
put her hand to her side and then again
seemed to be considering her situation.
Whatever her decision, she must have
accepted it philosophically, for this time,
more deliberately, she sought another resting
place. Fortunately not far away was
a better shelter of rocks, half a dozen of
them forming a kind of semicircular cave.
Deliberately Polly crept toward their shelter
and there removed her hat and tied her
hair up in a long automobile veil. Then
she lay down in the sand with the stones
as a shield behind her and before her a
wonderful view of the night as it stole
softly over the desert.</p>

<p>Polly was not afraid and not even
seriously annoyed. Life to her was but
a series of adventures, some of them good
and others less cheerful. She was not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
at all sure that she was not going to enjoy
this one and she could not believe that it
would do her any especial harm. She
was sleeping outdoors for the benefit of
her health in a small porch attached to
her hotel bedroom. Perhaps the sand
was less comfortable and clean than her
bed, but then she had never before imagined
so much sky and prairie. Moreover, there
was no one to worry over her failure to
appear except Marie, her maid. It was
just possible that Marie might arouse the
hotel and a searching party be sent to
find her. In that case Polly knew that
she would be glad to return to civilization.
However, she did not intend to worry if
no one came. Her hunger and thirst
must be forgotten until morning.</p>

<p>Somehow, when the stars came out, in
spite of the beauty of the night Polly
found she could not manage to keep her
eyes open. She was not exactly sleepy,
only tired. For never in years had she
had such an opportunity to think things
over. How crowded her life had been,
how full of hard work, of failure and success,
yes, and loneliness! She was willing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
to confess it tonight to herself. How she
would have liked to have had one of her
old Camp Fire friends here in Colorado
with her! Yet they were all too busy
and she had not wished any one of her
family to know how ill she had been. How
much trouble she had always given all the
people who cared for her ever since she
could remember! Polly's conscience pricked
her sharply. Why had she not married
and settled down as her sister Mollie had
suggested at least a hundred times? Because
she would not give up her acting?
Well, she need not have done this had
she married Richard Hunt. But too many
years had passed since their engagement
had been broken for her to recall him.
She had not even seen Mr. Hunt in the
past five years, although they had occasionally
acted in the same cities and at
the same time.</p>

<p>Finally, however, when the famous Miss
O'Neill actually fell asleep she was smiling
faintly. For a vision had suddenly come
to her of how shocked her sister Mollie
and her brother-in-law, Mr. William Webster,
would be if they knew that she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
sleeping alone on the edge of a desert.
But she was surely too near the village
to be in any danger from wild animals and
no one would undertake such a walk as
hers had been at this hour.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, wisdom should have
prompted an old Camp Fire girl to have
found twigs enough to have started even
a miniature camp fire. But the edge of
a desert is scarcely the place where wood
abounds and the fact is, though she had
thought of it, Polly had been too tired
to make the necessary effort. For goodness
only knows how much farther she need
have wandered before coming to an oasis
of shrubbery or trees.</p>

<p>When at last Miss O'Neill opened her
eyes actually it was broad daylight and
standing before her was a figure that almost
fitted into her dream. For the girl was
just about the age of the group of friends
who had once lived together in a log house
in the woods, and all night she had been
dreaming of Sunrise Cabin.</p>

<p>Nevertheless her visitor bore no other
resemblance to them, so that the distinguished
lady rubbed her eyes, wondering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
if she were yet awake and how the girl
could have come so close up to her without
her hearing.</p>

<p>A glance explained this, for the intruder
was barefooted and her legs and feet were
so brown and hard they appeared totally
unfamiliar with shoes and stockings.</p>

<p>She was staring so hard at Polly that she
seemed scarcely conscious of anything except
her own surprise.</p>

<p>With an effort Miss O'Neill sat upright.
She did not feel tired now in the least, but
gloriously rested and strengthened from
her wonderful night out of doors in the
clear, pure air. But of course she must
explain her situation to the little girl before
her, although she would have preferred her
discoverer to have explained herself.</p>

<p>In spite of being about fourteen years
old, this child had on only a thin yellow
calico frock, and it was late October. Her
hair was perfectly straight and Polly might
have thought her an Indian except that it
was light brown in color, although a good
deal stained by wind and sun. However,
the girl's eyes were a kind of greenish gray
in shade and her features were delicately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
modeled. But she had a peculiar and not
an agreeable expression.</p>

<p>"I wandered away from my hotel last
evening and was not able to return, so I
slept here all night. How did you happen to
find me?" Polly began, feeling that some
one must start a conversation in order to
persuade her companion to cease her almost
frightened staring. Of course Polly appreciated
that she herself was not looking her
best, but there was no reason why she
should excite so much curiosity.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding she received no answer.
With a slight gesture of annoyance Miss
O'Neill stood up. After all, she did not
feel as energetic as she had thought and it
was undoubtedly a long walk back to her
hotel.</p>

<p>"Do you live anywhere near here? I am
both hungry and thirsty. If you could
find some one to help me I should be most
grateful," Polly said as politely as if she
had been speaking to a friend. For if the
girl was afraid of her she wished her to
forget her timidity.</p>

<p>But instead of replying the strange child
stared harder than ever for half a minute,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and then before Polly could speak again or
touch her she was off, running across the
sand like a deer, without a backward glance.</p>

<p>Miss O'Neill watched her for some time
until she vanished into what appeared at
this distance to be a clump of trees. Then
she deliberately set out to follow her. The
child must have come from some place
nearer than the village where she was staying.
In almost any kind of settlement she
would be able to find a horse to take her
back to her hotel.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>"<span class="smcap">Bobbin</span>"<br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>ALL her life Polly O'Neill had felt a
curious shrinking from physical
cruelty, and growing older had not
made the least change in her feeling. She
had never talked about it, but had always
been fearful that at heart she was a
coward. The Camp Fire girls used to laugh
at her because, of course, she had learned
to do all of the things that their rules
required without feeling any possible nervousness.
But then no one of them understood
what physical cruelty might mean and
possibly might never see an exhibition of it.</div>

<p>Yet nothing was farther from her own
mind at the present moment than this fear.
She had come in about fifteen minutes'
walk to a clump of cottonwood trees by a
small stream of water, and there in their
midst stood a crude two-room shanty with
a bare space of ground in front of it and a
lean dog sitting in a patch of sunshine.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>But the sight that froze Polly's blood
and made her stand suddenly so still that
she might have been a wooden image was
the figure of a man with a long whip in
his hand, such as one might have used in
driving cattle. And this whip was now
whirling and stinging through the air and
twisting itself about the body of the little
girl who had been the first vision that Miss
O'Neill's eyes had rested upon on waking
that morning.</p>

<p>But the strangest thing of all was that
the child was making no outcry and showing
no effort to run away. Indeed, she stood
perfectly still, hugging half a loaf of bread
in her arms.</p>

<p>Polly made an inarticulate sound which
she thought was a loud cry: "Stop!" But
the man had not seen her approach and was
too occupied with his hateful task to hear
her, and to her intense shame she felt all
at once desperately afraid of him. She was
so far from any one she knew, she had so
little physical strength and this man was so
much more brutal than any one she had ever
seen before in her life. Perhaps he would
cease hurting the child this instant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, without in the least knowing when
nor how she had accomplished it, Polly
rushed forward and seizing the man's thick
wrist in her own slender fingers, clung to
him desperately, while the thong of the
whip curled and fell in a limp fashion about
her own shoulders.</p>

<p>Too surprised to speak, the man took a
step or two backward. In the course of
her stage career Polly had acted a number
of tragedy queens; and notwithstanding her
slightly rumpled appearance at this moment,
she had never looked the part better
than now. Her thin figure was drawn up
to its fullest height, her Irish blue eyes
flashed Celtic lightnings. She even stamped
her foot imperiously.</p>

<p>"You beast!" she exclaimed. "What do
you mean by striking a little girl in that
cruel fashion? I'll have you arrested! I
don't care in the least if you are her father
or what she has done, you have no possible
right to be so brutal."</p>

<p>The man had dropped his whip to the
ground and Polly now stooped and picked
it up. It was absurd of her ever to have
dreamed she could have been frightened by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
mere brute strength. The man was a good
deal more afraid of her for the instant.
The sudden apparition of a fashionably
dressed young woman, appearing out of
nowhere and springing upon him in such a
surprising fashion, had destroyed his nerve.</p>

<p>"I wasn't doin' nawthin I hadn't a right
ter," he growled. "That young 'un is allers
stealin' somethin'. I caught her red-handed
running off with that there loaf of bread."</p>

<p>For the first time since her arrival on the
scene Polly O'Neill turned toward the girl.
She was still staring at her with almost the
same expression she had worn earlier in the
day. But somehow something in her look
touched Polly, brought her sudden inspiration.</p>

<p>"Why," she exclaimed with a break in
her voice, "I believe she was bringing the
bread to me. I told her I was hungry just
a little while ago."</p>

<p>There was no one in the world who could
be sweeter or simpler than Polly O'Neill
when her feelings were deeply touched.
This had always been true, even as a young
girl, and of course, as she had grown into a
famous woman, her charm had deepened.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Now she put her arms about her new
friend's shoulders. "You were going to
give the bread to me, I'm sure. Thank you."
Oblivious of the fact that the little
girl's dress was exceedingly dirty and that
her face was far from clean, Polly leaned
over and kissed her.</p>

<p>Then she turned to the man. "If you
will get a horse and drive me to my hotel
I will pay you well for it," she explained.</p>

<p>In reply the man nodded and moved
away, so that Polly was once more left
alone with the girl.</p>

<p>It suddenly occurred to her that the child
had never spoken since their meeting.
Could she possibly be deaf and dumb? That
might explain her strange expression.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" Polly asked
gently.</p>

<p>Still the girl stared. Miss O'Neill repeated
her question.</p>

<p>Then the girl, picking up a stick from the
ground, slowly and laboriously printed in
big letters, such as a child of six might have
made, the word "Bobbin."</p>

<p>"Bobbin?" Polly repeated the name
aloud as she read it. What an extraordinary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
title! One could scarcely call it a
name.</p>

<p>"Is that the only name you have?" she
inquired again, wondering at the same time
how it was possible for the little girl to
understand what she said without being
able to reply. But Bobbin bowed her head,
showing that she had understood. In
some fashion she must have learned the lip
language. Yet it was curious why if the
girl had ever been sent to school she had
learned nothing else. She appeared the
veriest little savage that ever lived so close
to wealth and civilization.</p>

<p>Polly sought in her mind to find out what
she could do or say to show her gratitude.
She had a sudden feeling that she could not
turn her back upon the girl and leave her
to her wretched fate, and yet of course the
child had no claim upon her. It was something
in the expression of Bobbin's eyes
that seemed to haunt one.</p>

<p>With a slight, unnoticeable shrug of her
shoulders, as though giving up the problem
as too much for her, Polly now slipped her
hand into her pocket, drawing out her
purse bag. Opening it she found a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
large silver dollar, such as one uses in the
West.</p>

<p>"Won't you buy yourself something from
me?" she asked, trying to speak as distinctly
as possible. She had not observed
that in taking out the money she had carelessly
dropped a handkerchief from her bag.</p>

<p>With a fleeting expression of pleasure
the girl accepted the gift, but the next
instant, when Polly turned to watch the
man who was now approaching her with a
lean horse hitched to a cart, she swooped
down toward the ground and picking up the
crumpled white object thrust it secretively
inside her dress.</p>

<p>Five minutes after, when Polly and the
man had started for Colorado Springs,
Bobbin remained in the same position,
watching them until they were out of sight.
Then she began eating the neglected bread.</p>

<p>Upon arriving safely at her hotel, Miss
O'Neill discovered that the news of her
disappearance had been spread abroad by
her frightened maid, and that a thorough
search was being made for her. For
although Polly had been trying to live as
quietly as possible in a small, obscure hotel,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the fact of her visit was well known to
hundreds of people. You see, at this time
in her life not only was her name celebrated
from one part of the country to the other,
but her face was equally familiar.</p>

<p>Through her maid, Marie, Polly was told
that a gentleman, whose name she had not
learned, had been particularly kind and
interested in seeking to find her. So as soon
as she rested she had every intention of
inquiring his name and thanking him personally.
But by late afternoon, when she
finally dressed, this was impossible. Evidently
the man did not wish to be annoyed
by her thanks, for the message brought her
was that on hearing of her safety he had
suddenly left the village.</p>

<p>However, Polly was able to acquire some
actual information about the girl she had
seen earlier in the day, for "Bobbin" was
apparently a well-known character in the
famous <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Westen'">Western</ins> resort. She was a little
stray daughter of the place. Years before,
the mother had come to Colorado from some
city in the South and had died. Afterwards
no one had ever claimed the child.</p>

<p>So the town had taken care of her, sent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
her to school and tried to teach her to talk.
She was perhaps not entirely deaf, although
no one exactly understood her case. But
the girl was a hopeless little rebel. In no
place would she stay unless kept there by
iron bars. She seemed to have an unconquerable
desire to be always out of doors,
and in the brilliant Colorado climate this
was nearly always possible. Recently she
had been living with some gypsy people, who
had established themselves in a temporary
shanty at some little distance from the roads
usually followed by sightseers. So Miss
O'Neill had certainly wandered from the
beaten track. Nevertheless she need not
make herself unnecessarily unhappy over
"Bobbin," for the girl would again be
brought back to school as soon as she could
be captured.</p>

<p>Yes, her name had been Roberta, an old-fashioned
Southern name, and then in some
way it had been shortened to Bobbie and
now Bobbin. The child had a last name, of
course, but the woman who told the story
to Miss O'Neill had either never heard the
mother's name or else had completely forgotten
it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>Late that night in reflecting over her
adventure Polly wished that she and Betty
Graham could have changed places for a
week or so. For Betty would certainly do
something for the unfortunate Bobbin to
make life happier for her, as she had a
kind of genius for looking after people.
Her Camp Fire training had taught her a
beautiful sympathy and understanding. But
Betty must have been made that way in the
beginning, Polly concluded with a sigh and
a smile. She had no such gift herself.
The girl's story, fragmentary as it was,
interested her, but there could be no possible
point in undertaking to interfere
with the child's future.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, try as she might, all night
it was impossible for the famous actress to
get the half tragic, half stupid figure of
Bobbin out of her vision.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'><span class="smcap">Back in New Hampshire</span><br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>BETTY was driving alone through one
of the less crowded parts of Concord.
She had been into the country and
was now on her way home again. Not very
often did she go out alone, but she had not
felt in a mood for company and had purposely
gotten away by herself.</div>

<p>A week had passed since her midnight
talk with Anthony and there was still a
coldness between them. Each day Betty
had expected her husband to declare that
he had changed his mind in regard to finding
a position for John Everett and would do
as she asked. Yet so far he had not even
referred to the subject.</p>

<p>On her way home Betty considered that
she had better stop and tell Meg how she
had failed in influence with her husband,
notwithstanding she could not decide just
what she should do or say. Meg would
not understand and might believe that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
she had made no real effort for John's sake.
Yet she could not be such a coward as to
leave her old friends in suspense. Since
Anthony would do nothing to help, it was
better that John Everett should know, so
that he might find another occupation.</p>

<p>They were passing through a quiet street
shaded by magnificent old maple trees
that were now bare except for a few clustering
brown leaves, when Mrs. Graham
leaned over to speak to her coachman and
the man drew in his horses. The next
moment her attention was attracted by
seeing some one on the sidewalk pause and
lift his hat to her. Betty had returned the
bow before she actually recognized John
Everett. Then he took two or three steps
forward and held out his hand.</p>

<p>"I was just going to see Meg," Betty
explained, blushing and wishing that she
could escape the confession that lay before
her. If John should question her now she
felt she might have a sudden panic of embarrassment.
Of course she could think
up some excuse for Anthony's unkindness;
she might even offer the same excuse he had
made to her. Yet the fact that he had declined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
to do what she so much desired
would remain the same.</p>

<p>But John Everett was smiling in the most
ordinary fashion.</p>

<p>"I wonder, Mrs. Graham, if you will
not let me ride along with you, if you are
going to Meg's. I am on the way home
myself."</p>

<p>Then in a short while Betty had forgotten
her worry and was having the same agreeable
talk of old times that she had enjoyed
the week before. Moreover, it was John
Everett who relieved her from her chagrin.</p>

<p>"By the way," he began, just as they
were about to arrive at Mrs. Jack Emmet's
house, "please don't worry, Mrs. Graham,
or Betty, if I may call you by the
old name, about asking your husband to
fix me up with a position in his office. I
know the new Governor is being overwhelmed
with office seekers. I have been
lucky enough to secure something to do
with my brother-in-law, Jack Emmet, and
ex-Governor Peyton. They have a new
business scheme on hand in which they
think I may be useful."</p>

<p>Of course, Betty could not utter her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
thanksgiving aloud, although she repeated
it very fervently to herself. So, after all,
she need not confess to other people
Anthony's lack of consideration. It was
enough that she should be carrying the hurt
feeling about inside her own heart. Instead,
she merely murmured something or other
that was not clear, about the Governor's
having been so very busy recently and having
some special annoyance in his affairs. She
was by no means certain of just what she
said at the moment nor how she explained
the situation, but fortunately John Everett
did not appear to be particularly interested
in the subject.</p>

<p>Meg was not at home when they arrived,
but instead of saying good-bye, John suggested
that he should drive back to her own
home with Betty. It had been years since
they had seen each other, except the other
evening, and there was so much to talk
about.</p>

<p>Then John explained that he had taken
a small house in Concord and that his
father was soon coming to live with him.
Bumps would continue with his course at
Cornell for this winter anyhow. So, after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
all, there were uses in this world even for old
bachelors, he ended smilingly.</p>

<p>It was Betty, however, who suggested
that they should go and see this house, although
John told her it was a good deal out
of her way. Yet it was a beautiful warm
November afternoon and would not be
dark for another hour. Somehow Betty
did not feel that she wanted to go home
at once. Faith had gone for a walk
with Kenneth Helm, Angel had a half
holiday and was spending the afternoon
with the children. She and Bettina had a
wonderful secret game that they played
together in a room by themselves, where
no one else had ever been allowed to come.
There was no prospect of Anthony's returning
home for some time, so the Governor's
splendid mansion would seem big and empty
to the Governor's wife for an hour or so
more at any rate.</p>

<p>There was a caretaker in the little white
house with green shutters, who was anxious
to show Mrs. Graham and Mr. Everett
every detail of it. The house was to be let
furnished and yet it seemed to have been
peculiarly fitted for old Professor Everett's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
needs. It was pleasant for Betty to imagine
the sweet-tempered, learned old man
here with John and near his daughter Meg.
He had been living alone in Woodford ever
since his younger son, Horace, departed for
college. Somehow Betty felt that it would
be pleasant for her also to have the old
gentleman living so near by. He had been
a devoted friend of Mr. Ashton's, whom
she had certainly loved even more than an
own father.</p>

<p>"I shall be running in here very often to
see Professor Everett and tell him the
things that trouble me, just as Meg and I
used to do when we were little girls,"
Betty remarked to her companion. "He
was the one person who never by any possible
chance believed that Meg or I could
ever be in fault."</p>

<p>"I'm sure he will always be overjoyed to
see you," John Everett replied. "Only it
is a little difficult for me to imagine Mrs.
Anthony Graham ever having anything
to trouble her."</p>

<p>As the November evenings grew dark so
soon, it was almost dusk when Betty at
length entered her own home after saying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
good-bye to her friend, who had insisted on
walking back to his sister's house instead
of allowing the coachman to drive him.</p>

<p>Going into her private sitting room,
Betty was surprised to find that Anthony
had come home and was sitting there pretending
to read. But most undeniably he
looked cross.</p>

<p>"I thought we were going to have a
drive and tea together, Betty," he remarked
reproachfully. "Where in the world
have you been? No one seemed to know.
I should think you would leave word where
you are going, so that if anything happened
to the children or to me the servants would
know where to find you."</p>

<p>Actually Anthony was reproaching her
in a perfectly unreasonable fashion! Betty
could hardly believe her ears, it was so
unlike him. Was he going to turn into the
dictatorial type of husband after all these
years of married life when he had been so
altogether different?</p>

<p>Usually Betty's temper was gracious and
sweet. Possibly if Anthony had approached
her in his usual fashion at this
moment they might have gotten over the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
feeling of estrangement that had come
between them for the first time since their
wedding. Moreover, the room was not
brightly lighted, so that Betty did not
notice how tired and worried Anthony
looked. Of course, fatigue and worry
explain almost any temporary unreasonableness
on the part of human beings.</p>

<p>Quite casually Betty began to draw off
her long gray suede gloves. She wore a
beautiful gray coat and skirt and chinchilla
furs and a hat with a single blue feather.</p>

<p>"Don't talk as if we lived in England
and you were a kind of domestic tyrant,
please, Anthony," she said lightly. "I am
sorry, but I had no possible way of knowing
that you were coming home from your
office so much earlier than usual. You
should have had some one telephone me.
I have been having a very agreeable drive
with John Everett. And, by the way, it
was not worth while for me to have annoyed
you by asking you to do me the favor of
giving John something to do. He tells
me he is going into business with Jack
Emmet and ex-Governor Peyton." Then
as she moved toward her own bedroom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Betty was surprised and annoyed by another
speech from her husband.</p>

<p>"I don't like the combination very well,"
he remarked quietly. "Neither Emmet
nor Peyton have very good business reputations.
They are going to try and get
a shaky bill through the Legislature in
the next month or so, I hear. But I suppose
Everett knows his own affairs best."</p>

<p>As Betty had now disappeared, she did
not hear Anthony's closing speech.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to have talked like a bear,
dear. Won't you forgive me and let us
be friends? I wish I could have fixed
up things for Everett for your sake, but
I could not feel that I had the right."</p>

<p>Moreover, the young Governor's back
was unfortunately turned, so he did not
appreciate that Betty had not heard him.
He was under the impression that she had
simply refused to pay any attention to
his apology.</p>

<p>Well, he was too tired to discuss the
matter any further for the present. He
had several important decisions that must
be made before morning and he and Betty
and Faith and Kenneth Helm were to go
to some big reception later in the evening.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'><span class="smcap">Loneliness</span><br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>NEVER in her entire career had
Polly O'Neill felt more depressed.
She was, of course, accustomed to
a very busy life filled with people and
excitement. Nothing else is possible to
an actor or actress, although Miss O'Neill
had tried to keep her private life as quiet
as possible.</div>

<p>But here in her little hotel about a mile
or more from the celebrated Colorado
Springs she was finding existence duller
than she had bargained for. In the first
place, on her arrival she had let it be known
that she desired no callers or acquaintances.
Her reason for giving up her work at the
present time was that she was greatly in
need of a rest cure, so visitors to the
Springs had taken her <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'at at'">at</ins> her word and
Miss O'Neill had been left to recover her
health unmolested. Now and then some
unknown admirer had appeared at her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
hotel or sent books and flowers. Nevertheless,
she had so far made no acquaintances.</p>

<p>However, after several weeks of the
wonderful, brilliant air, with nothing to
do except sleep and write an occasional
letter, Polly felt a good deal stronger.
Yet she did not feel that she was well
enough to return to Woodford, and today
the news from home had been depressing.</p>

<p>You see, Mollie had never been told
that her sister was ill and considered that
if she only required rest it might as well
be enjoyed at her own lovely big farm
as among strangers in the West. So this
morning her letter had urged Polly's return
home and had also imparted a great
variety of dispiriting reasons. In the
first place, Mollie told at great length
that Dan, who was Polly's favorite of her
sister's children, was not in good health
and that he was showing certain oddities
of disposition which struck his aunt as
very like her own. Indeed, she believed
that neither her sister nor brother-in-law
understood the delicate, difficult little fellow,
and she would have liked to have
been near enough to have helped him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
through a trying time. Then more disquieting
had been Mollie's information
about their mother, Mrs. Wharton, who
was beginning to show her age. Moreover,
Mr. Wharton seemed somewhat depressed
over his business affairs. Then
finally the most mystifying and in a way
disturbing of Mollie's statements had been
her account of Betty Graham.</p>

<p>For several weeks there had been no
line to Polly from her dearest friend,
which in itself had made Polly vaguely
uneasy. It was so unlike Betty ever to
fail in her weekly letter which had always
followed her friend to whatever part of
the world she happened to be. But now
Mollie announced that Betty had been on
a visit to her mother, Mrs. Ashton, in
Woodford, and that she had seemed entirely
unlike herself. Instead of having a great
deal to say she had been strangely quiet,
almost sad.</p>

<p>Moreover, the new Governor's enemies
were said to be making a tremendous effort
to destroy his reputation and there was a
great deal of talk going on about some
matter which Mollie did not claim to understand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Possibly Anthony's annoyances
may have been worrying his wife.</p>

<p>Polly had been sitting alone on her
small, private veranda which commanded
a wonderful view of a rim of hills, when
her sister's letter had been given her
along with her other mail.</p>

<p>Before glancing at the other communications
she had eagerly opened this. But
now she sat with the pages fluttering in
her lap and her eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>Naturally Mollie had not intended to
be so depressing; people seldom do seem
to realize just what effects their letters
may produce. Often they write merely
to relieve their own feelings and once
having put down all the gloomy possibilities
that worry them at the time, rise up and
go cheerfully about their business with
the evils forgotten.</p>

<p>So naturally it remains for the unfortunate
recipient of the letter to become
even more depressed than the writer had
been.</p>

<p>Moreover, Polly really wanted desperately
to go home. It had been many
months since she had seen her own people,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
and though they often believed her to
have less affection than other women, it
was not in the least true. She had given
up many things for her art and had sometimes
seemed selfish and cold-blooded. But
it wasn't fair that her sister, Mollie, always
seemed to think that she had never desired
a home of her own, babies and some
one to care for her supremely, that she
had never grown tired of the wandering
life her stage career forced her to lead.</p>

<p>Finally, however, Polly managed to smile
and give a characteristic shrug over her
own self-pity. There was nothing in the
world so silly. Like the rest of us she
knew this to be true, yet, like the rest
of us, now and then even this famous,
grown-up woman, who had most of the
things that people would give worlds
to possess, indulged in attacks of being
sorry for herself. Moreover, the day
before she had sent for her doctor and
he had positively refused to consider her
leaving Colorado for the present.</p>

<p>You may remember that Polly had a
certain inherited delicacy that used to
keep her mother uneasy, and lately it had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
troubled her. It was this fact she had
concealed from her family and friends,
so that now, though she was better, her
physician had scouted the idea of a return
East. Once near New York he was sure
she would begin to talk business with her
theatrical manager, or even undertake to
study a new play.</p>

<p>No, she must undoubtedly remain at
her post a while longer. And yet was it
really necessary to have her post quite
so lonely?</p>

<p>Just as this idea occurred to her, a slight
noise attracting her attention, Polly glanced
down into the garden below her veranda.</p>

<p>There stood Bobbin and the next moment
she had flung a poor little bouquet at her
feet. It was a strange offering, all prickly
cactus leaves with a single white flower
in their midst. For some absurd reason
it flashed through Polly's mind to wonder
if her offering could be in any way symbolic
of the girl who had given it her.
Could there be something beautiful hidden
within the child's peculiarities?</p>

<p>For this was not the first token of
affection that Bobbin had presented. Indeed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
many queer, small gifts had been
brought to the strange lady since their
first meeting, so that Polly had been
curiously touched. For of course Bobbin's
offerings came straight from her heart.
In her pathetic, shut-in world she had
no way of knowing anything of the history of
the woman whom she so plainly admired.</p>

<p>Yet inside Polly O'Neill's sitting room
at this moment there were four or five
tokens of affection that must have come
from her. They were too extraordinary
for any one else to have sent them and
had been laid at her shrine in too unusual
a way. For most of them had been literally
flung on her veranda. A few of
them, when she happened to be sitting
outdoors as she was doing at the present
moment, and the others when no one had
seen or known of their appearance.</p>

<p>One of the gifts was a beautiful blue
feather that must have fallen from some
unusual bird flying over the western lands,
another a stone that shone like the finest
crystal, in the sun, and a third a horseshoe
some small broncho must have shed in
trotting across the plains.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>However, never once had Polly been
able to thank her new friend for her gifts.
For always at the slightest movement on
her part Bobbin had turned and run away
more fleetly than any one else could.
For since Miss O'Neill's report that she
had found the girl living with such rough
people Bobbin had been recaptured and
brought back to the village to school.
Notwithstanding, she had once more escaped
and now either no one knew just where
she had gone or else no one had taken
the trouble to capture her a second time.</p>

<p>It occurred to Polly at this moment
that she would like to try and influence
the girl, or at any rate show her gratitude.
Besides, anything would be better than
spending the rest of the day bewailing her
own loneliness. Moreover, it would do
her good for a moment to compare her
own loneliness with Bobbin's!</p>

<p>Without a movement or a sign to the
girl to betray that she had even caught
sight of her, Polly at once slipped into
her bedroom and put on her coat and hat.
And she was down in her yard and
had stretched out her hand to touch her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
visitor before the girl became aware of
her.</p>

<p>Yet the very next instant Bobbin started
and began running as swiftly as she had
at their first meeting. And this time,
even more impetuously and with less reason,
Miss O'Neill pursued her.</p>

<p>It was ridiculous of Polly and utterly
undignified and unbecoming. No other
person in the world in her position would
have done such a thing. Yet she had no
more thought of its oddity and the attention
that she might create than if she had
been a Camp Fire girl in the New Hampshire
woods nearly fifteen years before.</p>

<p>Of course the woman could not run
half so fast as Bobbin in these days, but
it was only because she was not well, Polly
said to herself angrily. She had been the
swiftest runner of all the girls for short
distances in their old Sunrise Hill Club.
Of course Sylvia had used to get the better
of her in long distance tests. Still, even
now she was managing to keep Bobbin
in sight, although she had a horrid stitch
in her side and was already out of breath.</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, for Miss Polly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
O'Neill's reputation she was not at the
present time within the fashionable precincts
of Colorado Springs, else she might
possibly have been thought to have gone
suddenly mad. Her hotel was some distance
out in the country and there were
but few houses in its neighborhood. Moreover,
Bobbin was running away from
the town and not toward it.</p>

<p>The road was a level, hard one, but
all at once Polly felt a queer pain that
took her breath completely away and then
a sudden darkness.</p>

<p>She did not fall, however, because some
one who was walking in the direction of
her hotel reached her just in time.</p>

<p>Then to her amazement Polly heard an
exclamation that had in some unexplainable
way a familiar note in it. The next
moment when straightening up and opening
her eyes she seemed to be reposing
in the arms of a tall man with dark
eyes and gray hair, whom she had once
known extremely well, but had not seen
in the past five years.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'><span class="smcap">A Meeting and an Explanation</span><br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>"I&mdash;I was running," explained Miss
O'Neill as soon as she had sufficient
breath to speak.</div>

<p>Which was such an absurdly unnecessary
statement of an apparent fact that
her rescuer smiled against his will.</p>

<p>He was not pleased at this meeting with
Miss Polly O'Neill. It was true that he
had been walking out to her hotel to make
inquiries concerning her health, but he
had no thought or desire to see her. Indeed,
deep down in his heart he believed
that few women had ever treated a man
much worse than she had treated him
and he had never even tried to forgive
her. For several years they had been
engaged to be married, only postponing
the wedding because of Polly's youth and
because she wanted to go on with her
acting for a few years longer without
interruption. Then when Richard Hunt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
had insisted that he was not young and
could not wait forever, with characteristic
coolness Polly had broken her engagement.
She had written him of her change of
mind and heart and he had accepted her
letter as final. Never once since had
they met face to face until this minute.</p>

<p>Yet now Richard Hunt found himself
holding the same young woman in his
arms, rather against his will, of course,
but not knowing what else to do with
her since she scarcely looked strong enough
to stand alone.</p>

<p>"I think I would like to sit down for
a moment," Polly volunteered finally and
managed to cross over to the opposite side
of the road, where she established herself
very comfortably on a carefully cultivated
mound of grass.</p>

<p>Her rescuer stood over her. "May I
do anything for you, Miss O'Neill?" he
inquired formally. "I think it might be
well for me to find your maid."</p>

<p>He was about to move off when Polly
with her usual lack of dignity fairly clutched
the back of his overcoat.</p>

<p>"Oh, please don't go, Mr. Hunt&mdash;Richard,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
she ended after a slight hesitation.
"Really, I don't understand why you have
treated me so unkindly all these years. I
don't see the least reason why we should
not have continued to be friends. Still,
you were going to my hotel to call on me.
There isn't any other possible reason why
you were marching out this particular road,
which does not lead anywhere else." And
at this Miss O'Neill smiled with open and
annoying satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I hadn't the faintest idea of asking to
see you," Richard Hunt announced firmly,
although a little surprised by Polly's friendly
manner. If they had been parted for a
matter of five weeks instead of five years,
and if the cause of their separation had
been only some slight disagreement rather
than something affecting their whole lives,
she could not have appeared more nonchalant
and at the same time more cordial.
But then there never had been any way
of accounting for Polly O'Neill's actions
and probably never would be. However,
Richard Hunt had no desire again to subject
himself to her moods. He wished very
much to walk on, and yet he could not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
make up his mind to remove her hand
forcibly from his coat. Moreover, she
looked too pale and exhausted to be left
alone. Yet this had always been a well-known
method by which Polly had succeeded
in gaining her own point, he remembered.</p>

<p>"Then what were you going to my hotel
for? Didn't you even know I was staying
there?" she demanded, finding breath
enough to ask questions, in spite of her exhaustion
of a few moments before.</p>

<p>If only he had been a less truthful man!
For a moment Richard Hunt contemplated
making up some entirely fanciful story,
then he put the temptation aside.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, his manner and answer
were far more crushing to Miss Polly
O'Neill than if he had told her a lie which she
would probably have seen through at once.</p>

<p>Always he had commanded more respect
from her than any man she had ever known
in her life, which was secretly mingled with
a little wholesome awe. Polly had always
put it down to the fact that he was so much
older than she was. But she had had other
acquaintances among older men.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>"You misunderstood me, Miss O'Neill,
when I said that I was coming to your hotel
without any intention of seeing you. That
was true, but I was coming with the idea
of inquiring how you were. You see, I also
have been staying in this part of the country,
and not long ago I read in one of the papers
that you were here and seriously ill. Afterwards
I learned that you were alone. Your
family and friends have always been so kind
to me that it appeared to me my duty to
find out your true condition. I of course
guessed that you had not told them the
truth."</p>

<p>Richard Hunt gazed severely down at the
crumpled young woman at his feet, ending
his speech as cruelly as possible.</p>

<p>"Well, I like that!" Polly returned
weakly, falling into slang with entire unconsciousness.
"Here I have been suffering
perfect agonies of loneliness and crying my
eyes out every day because I so wanted
mother and Mollie and Betty to come to
me. And I only did not let them know I
was ill, to keep them from worrying. Yet
you make it sound just as if I were keeping
my tiresome old breakdown a secret from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the pure love of fibbing inherent in my
wicked nature. I do think you are&mdash;mean!"</p>

<p>Was there ever such another grown-up
woman as Polly O'Neill? Actually there
were tears in her eyes as she ended her
speech, relinquishing her hold on her companion
in order to fish about in her pocket
for a handkerchief, which she failed to find.</p>

<p>With entire gravity Mr. Hunt presented
his, and Polly, wiping her eyes and perspiring
forehead, coolly retained the handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Don't you think you are strong enough
now to permit me to take you back to your
hotel, if I may not look for your maid?"
the man suggested, wondering if his companion
had any idea of how absurd their position
was, nor of how much he desired to get
away from her.</p>

<p>However, she only sighed comfortably.
"Oh, thank you very much, but don't
trouble. I am perfectly all right now. I was
only out of breath because I was running
after a little girl who is as fleet as a deer.
But I don't want to go back to my hotel
unless you were coming to see me. I was
much too lonely there. I'll just walk along
with you and after a while, if I am tired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
again, perhaps we may find a bench and
you'll sit down with me. Of course I know
you are too dignified to sit on the grass like
I am doing."</p>

<p>Without the least assistance Polly rose
up and stood beside her companion, smiling
at him somewhat wistfully.</p>

<p>What else could any man do except agree
to her wishes? Besides, she had him cornered
either way. For now if he continued
his journey toward her hotel she would
assuredly accompany him, and she had also
volunteered to walk the other way.</p>

<p>Moreover, it would seem too surly and
disgruntled to refuse so simple a courtesy
to an old acquaintance.</p>

<p>So Polly and her former friend walked
slowly along in the brilliant Colorado sunshine
in air so clear that it seemed almost
dazzling. Beyond they could see the tops
of snow-covered mountains tinted azure by
the sky. It would have been humanly impossible
to have felt unfriendly toward any
human being in such circumstances and on
such a day.</p>

<p>Every now and then Polly would glance
surreptitiously toward her companion's face.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Gracious, he did look older! His hair was
almost entirely gray and his expression
certainly less kind. Polly wondered if he
had really minded their broken engagement.
Surely he had never cared seriously
for so unreliable a person! She must have
seemed only a foolish school girl to him,
incapable of knowing her own mind. For
of course if he had not felt in this way he
would have made some effort to persuade
her to change her decision. How often she
used to lie awake wondering why he did not
write or come to her? Well, he was probably
grateful enough for his escape by this
time.</p>

<p>Then without in the least knowing what
she was going to say nor why she said it,
Polly inquired suddenly:</p>

<p>"Richard, do you think Margaret Adams
is happy in her marriage? I have so often
wondered. Of course she writes me she is."</p>

<p>Several years before, Miss Adams had
married one of the richest men in New
York City and since then had retired permanently
from the stage. Indeed, many
persons considered that Polly had succeeded
to her fame and position.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Richard Hunt shook his head. "Really,
I don't know any more than you do, Miss
Polly," he returned. "But she has a fine
son and certainly looks to me to be happy."</p>

<p>Polly smiled. At least she had succeeded
in persuading her companion to call her
"Miss Polly." That was a step in the right
direction, for in spite of her own boldness
in using his first name as she had done years
before, up to this moment she had been
addressed as Miss O'Neill.</p>

<p>But there were so many things to say
that she quite forgot in what way she
should say them and talked on every
minute of the time.</p>

<p>She had been so lonely, so depressed until
now, that life had seemed to have lost
almost all its former interest.</p>

<p>When she was plainly too tired to go
further Richard Hunt sat down with her
on a wayside bench for ten minutes. Then
he resolutely rose and said good-bye.</p>

<p>"I am ever so glad to find that you are
so much better," he concluded finally. "I
see there is no cause for anxiety." Yet
even as he spoke the man wondered how
any human being could manage to be as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
delicate looking as Polly O'Neill and yet do
all the things she was able to accomplish?
Just now, of course, she did look rather
worse than usual for her run; and then the
walk afterwards had used up her strength.
Besides, she had been trying so hard to
persuade her old friend again to cherish a
little liking for her and at this moment
was convinced of her failure.</p>

<p>She shook her head. "Thank you," she
answered quietly. "It has done me good
to have seen some one of whom I am
fond. It hasn't been altogether cheerful
being out here ill and alone. It was kind
of you to have cared enough to inquire
about me. I suppose you will soon be
going back to work. Good luck and
farewell."</p>

<p>Polly reached out her slender hand,
which was white and small with blue
veins upon it. In her haste on leaving her
apartment she had, of course, forgotten
gloves.</p>

<p>However, instead of shaking her hand
quietly, as both of them expected, Richard
Hunt raised her fingers to his lips.</p>

<p>"I am not going away from Colorado immediately.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
May I come and see you soon
again?" he inquired. A few minutes before
he had not the slightest intention of ever
deliberately trying to see Polly O'Neill
alone as long as they lived. But she did
look so forlorn and as lonely as a forsaken
little girl. No one could ever have guessed
that this was the celebrated Miss O'Neill
whose acting had charmed many thousands
of people during the last eight or ten years.</p>

<p>Polly bit her lips. "Then you will come?
I was afraid to ask you," she replied. "I
want so much to tell you about a queer
little girl whom I have come across out in
these wilds. Her name is Bobbin and she
seems to be deaf and dumb. I feel that I
ought to do something for her and don't
know exactly what to do. Perhaps I'll
adopt her, although I'm afraid the family
and Betty Graham won't approve. But
anyhow, Sylvia, the well-known Doctor Sylvia
Wharton, who is a children's specialist,
may be able to do something for her."</p>

<p>Naturally this idea of adopting Bobbin
had not dawned upon Polly until the instant
of announcing it. But the more she
thought of taking the girl to Sylvia's care<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the more the idea appealed to her. Besides,
Bobbin perhaps might awaken Mr.
Hunt's interest if he could see the child
and hear her tragic story. The little girl
might be made attractive with her queer
eyes and sunburned hair, if she were
cleaner and more civilized.</p>

<p>"You will come some day and help me
decide what to do, won't you?" Polly
urged. "One's chief difficulty is not alone
that Bobbin won't be adopted, she won't
even let herself be discovered. She is such
a queer, wild little thing."</p>

<p>Then she watched her companion until
he was entirely out of sight and afterwards
got up and strolled slowly home.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'><span class="smcap">The Way Home</span><br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>NOT a long time afterward Bobbin
must have changed her mind for
some reason or other, for voluntarily
she came to call on Miss O'Neill.
That is, she appeared in the garden and
threw a queer scarlet flower up to the
veranda. Then she waited without trying
to escape when Polly came down to talk to
her. And evidently she must have felt,
somewhere back in the odd recesses of her
mind, that she was to be considered a visitor,
for she had washed her face and hands
and even her hair. Indeed, though it hung
perfectly straight, Polly thought that she
had never seen more splendid hair in her
life, it held such strange bright colors
from being always exposed to the sun and
air; besides, it was long and heavy.</div>

<p>Moreover, Bobbin wore <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'a nold'">an old</ins> red jacket,
which some one recently had given her, over
the same pitiful calico dress.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>By and by, using all the tact she possessed,
Polly persuaded her visitor out of
the yard and up-stairs to her own rooms.
Of course Marie, the maid, was shocked
and displeased, but after all she was fairly
accustomed to her mistress's eccentricities.
Moreover, after a little while she too
became interested in Bobbin. The first
thing Polly undertook to do was to feed
her visitor. She had an idea that Bobbin
might be hungry, but she did not dream
how hungry. The girl ate like a little
wolf, ravenously, secretly if it had been
possible. Only, fortunately, she had learned
something of table manners from her
occasional training in institutions, so that
she at least understood the use of a knife
and fork, and altogether her hostess was
less horrified than she had expected to be.</p>

<p>Later on Bobbin and Polly undertook to
have a conversation. This they managed
by acquiring large sheets of paper and
nicely sharpened pencils. But it was astonishing
how easily Bobbin appeared to
understand whatever her new friend said
to her and how readily she seemed to be
willing to accept her suggestions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>The truth is that the half savage little
girl had conceived a sudden, unexplainable
devotion to the strange lady whom she had
discovered asleep on the sands. Perhaps
Bobbin too may have dreamed dreams and
imagined quaint fairy tales, so that Polly's
appearance answered some fancy of her own.
But whatever it was, she had offered her
faithful allegiance to this possible fairy
princess or just ordinary, human woman.
Yet how Bobbin was to keep the faith it was
well that neither she nor Polly knew at the
present time.</p>

<p>However, by the end of her visit the girl
had promised to go back to the home which
the town had provided for her and to do her
best to learn all she could. As a reward
for this she was to be allowed to make other
visits to Miss O'Neill. She was even to be
allowed to eat from the same blue and
white china and drink tea from the same
blue cup.</p>

<p>Moreover, before Bobbin's final departure
Marie persuaded her into the bathroom
and half an hour later she came forth beautifully
clean and dressed in a discarded
costume of Polly's, which was too long for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
her, but otherwise served very well. It was
merely a many times washed white silk
shirt waist and blue serge walking skirt and
coat. They made Bobbin appear rather
absurd and old, so that Polly was not sure
she had not liked her best in her rags.
However, both Bobbin and Marie were too
pleased for her to offer criticism; yet,
notwithstanding, Polly made up her mind
that she would try and purchase the girl
more suitable clothes as soon as possible
and that she would write and ask Betty
Graham's and Sylvia's advice in regard to
her.</p>

<p>For Richard Hunt had not come to see
her since their accidental meeting and
she could hope for no interest from him.
Polly wished she had never laid eyes
upon him, for their little talk had only
served to start a chain of memories she
wished forgotten. Besides, of course, she
felt lonelier than ever, since there is
nothing so depressing as waiting for a
friend who does not come.</p>

<p>Soon after dinner that evening Polly
undressed and put on a pretty kind of
tea gown of dark red silk, the color she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
had always fancied ever since girlhood.
She was idling about in her sitting room
wondering what she could do to amuse
herself when unexpectedly Mr. Hunt was
announced.</p>

<p>"Why, Polly," he began on entering,
his manner changed from the coldness of
their first meeting, "do you know what
that gown you are wearing brings back
to me? Our talk in the funny little boarding
house in Boston so many years ago,
when you explained to me that you had
run off and were in hiding in order to try
and learn to be an actress. I wish I
could tell you how proud I am of your
success."</p>

<p>But Polly did not wish to talk of her
success tonight. So she only shrugged her
shoulders. "Oh, I have always been doing
foolish things for the sake of my acting
and yet I don't seem to amount to
much."</p>

<p>After this visit Richard Hunt returned
half a dozen times. Polly did not understand
whether he was acting in the West
not far from Colorado Springs or whether
he too was taking a holiday. She asked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the question once, but as her old friend
did not answer her explicitly she let the
matter drop.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it was quite true that from
the time his visits began she grew steadily
better. Finally, about ten days before
Christmas, Miss O'Neill's physician announced
that she might return to the
New Hampshire hills to complete her
cure at her sister's home.</p>

<p>Then came the hour of final decision in
regard to Bobbin.</p>

<p>Of course Polly could not adopt the girl
in the conventional sense. It would have
been impossible to have her travel about
with her or to have kept her constantly
with her. And even if it had been possible
this was not what Bobbin needed. Fortunately
for Polly, Richard Hunt's ideas
on the subject were far more sensible than
her own. Between them it was decided
that Bobbin should travel east with Miss
O'Neill and her maid and spend Christmas
at the big Webster farm. Mollie had
written she would be glad to have her.
Then later Bobbin was to see Sylvia Wharton
and be put into some school where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
she might learn to talk and perhaps acquire
some useful occupation.</p>

<p>There was no difficulty in persuading
the town authorities to permit the little
girl to follow her new friend. Indeed, the
child had always been a tremendous problem
and they were more than glad to be
rid of the burden. She seemed completely
changed by Miss O'Neill's influence. She
was far quieter and more tractable and
had not run away in several weeks.
Besides this she appeared to be learning
all kinds of things in the most extraordinary
fashion. However, her teacher explained
this to Polly by saying that Bobbin had
always been unusually clever, but that
some wild streak in her nature had kept
her from making any real effort until now.</p>

<p>Another peculiarity of the girl's which
Polly remembered having seen an example
of on the morning of their first meeting
was that she had absolutely no sensation
of physical fear. Either nothing hurt her
very much or else she was indifferent to
pain. For this reason it had always been
impossible either to punish her or to make
her aware of danger. The thought interested<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Polly, since she considered herself
something of a coward. She wondered if
some day she and Bobbin might not change
places and the little girl be discovered
taking care of her.</p>

<p>However, when the three women finally
started east there was nothing unusual in
the appearance of any one of them. For
by this time Polly's prot&eacute;g&eacute; was dressed
like any other girl of her age with her
hair neatly braided. There only remained
her peculiar fashion of staring.</p>

<p>Richard Hunt saw the little party off.
He expected to be in New York later in
the winter and promised to write and
inquire what had become of Bobbin. However,
he did not promise to come to Woodford
to see Miss O'Neill, although Polly
more than once invited him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>"<span class="smcap">A Little Rift Within the Lute</span>"<br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>"BUT, my dearest sister, what is the
matter with Betty? You were
perfectly right, she isn't one bit
like herself and neither is Anthony. I
don't even believe she was particularly
glad to see me when I stopped over in
Concord with her for a few days."</div>

<p>Polly O'Neill was in her sister Mollie's
big, sunshiny living room in her splendid
old farm-house near Sunrise Cabin. There
was no specially handsome furniture in the
room, perhaps nothing particularly beautiful
in itself, yet Polly had just announced
that it was the very homiest room in all
the world and for that reason the nicest.</p>

<p>There were low book-shelves on two
sides <ins title="Transcriber's Note: this word not present in original text">of</ins> the room, for though Mollie never
read anything except at night when her
husband read aloud to her, Billy Webster
kept up with all the latest books, fiction,
history, travel, besides subscribing to most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
of the magazines in the country. Indeed,
although he and Polly often quarreled good-naturedly,
Polly was openly proud of her
brother-in-law, who had turned out to be
a more intelligent and capable man than
she had ever expected.</p>

<p>But besides Billy's books there were
lots of old chairs, some of them rather
worn, but all delightfully comfortable; a
great big table, now littered with children's
toys; the old-fashioned couch upon which
Polly was reposing; some ornaments belonging
to ancestral Websters and a tall
grandfather's clock, besides half a dozen
engravings and etchings on the walls.</p>

<p>Mollie was sitting in a low chair dressing
a big china doll. The sunshine lingered
on her dark hair, her plump pink
cheeks and her happy expression. For
she was in a delightful state of content
with the world. Was not her beloved
Polly at home for the Christmas festivities
and were not Billy and the children and
her mother in excellent health and
spirits?</p>

<p>Yet she looked a little uneasy over her
sister's question. For Betty was nearer to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
her heart than any one outside her own
family.</p>

<p>"So you noticed it too, Polly?" she
returned, stopping her work for a moment
and gazing out the great glass window.
Outside in the snow her three children
were playing, her little girl, Polly, and
Billy and Dan. Bobbin was standing a
short distance away watching them intently.
Indeed, ever since her arrival at
the farm she seemed to have done almost
nothing except look and look with all her
might and main. The girl seemed scarcely
to wish either to eat or sleep. And at
first this had worried her new friends, until
suddenly Polly had realized what a wonderful
new experience Mollie's home and
family were to this child who had never
seen anything in the least like it in her
whole life.</p>

<p>But Mollie was not watching the children.
Polly got up and leaned on her
elbow to discover what had attracted her
sister's attention. For only a few moments
before the children had been sent outdoors
to keep them from tiring the aunt whom
they adored.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>No, Mollie's gaze was fastened on a big
man who had just approached wearing a
heavy overcoat and a fur cap and carrying
a great bunch of mistletoe and holly
in his hands, which he was showing with
careful attention to the little girl visitor.</p>

<p>"Here comes Billy," she explained.
"Perhaps he can tell us."</p>

<p>Of course Polly laughed. "Gracious,
dear, isn't there anything in the world
you won't let your husband decide? I
should think that even Mr. William Webster
could hardly tell us what is troubling
our beloved Betty. And I don't know
that it is even right to ask him. You
see, old maids are shy about these things."</p>

<p>But in reply Mollie shook her head
reproachfully. "I was only going to ask
Billy about the difficulty Anthony is having
with his position as Governor," she
explained. "You see, I know there is
some kind of talk. People are saying he
is not being as honest as they expected.
There is a bill which ex-Governor Peyton
and Meg's husband, Jack Emmet, and her
brother, John, are trying to get through
the Legislature. Most people don't think<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the bill is honest and believe Anthony
should come out and say he is opposed
to it. But so far he has not said anything
one way or the other. I thought
maybe Betty was worrying because people
were thinking such hateful things about
Anthony. I simply couldn't stand it if
it were Billy."</p>

<p>"Wise Mollie!" her sister answered
thoughtfully. "You may be right, but
somehow there seemed to me to be something
else troubling Betty. If it were
only this political trouble, why shouldn't
she have confided in me?"</p>

<p>But at this instant William Webster
came into the room with a dozen letters
and almost as many newspapers in his
hands. Six of the letters he bestowed on
Polly, who opened five of them and stuck
the sixth inside her dress.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Billy Webster looked
up from the paper he was reading. "See
here," he said, "I don't like this. This
paper comes pretty near having an insulting
letter in it concerning Anthony Graham.
Of course it does not say anything
outright, but the insinuations are even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
worse. See, the article is headed: 'Is
Our Reform Governor So Honest As We
Supposed?' Then later on the writer suggests
that Anthony may not be above
taking graft himself. Everybody knows
he is a poor man."</p>

<p>Afterwards there was an unusual silence
in the big room until Billy turned inquiringly
toward his wife and sister-in-law.</p>

<p>"Don't take my question in the wrong
way, please," he began rather timidly.
"But is Betty Graham a very extravagant
woman? I know she was brought up to
have a great deal of money, and although
she was poor for a little while that may
not have made any difference. You see,
Anthony Graham is absolutely an honest
man, but everybody knows that he adores
his wife&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Billy stopped because quite in her old
girlhood fashion Polly had sprung up on
her sofa and her eyes were fairly blazing
at him.</p>

<p>"What utter nonsense, Billy Webster!
You ought to be ashamed of yourself for
suggesting such a thing. In the first
place, Betty is not extravagant, but even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
if she were she would most certainly rather
be dead than have Anthony do a dishonest
thing on her account. Besides, if Anthony
is your friend and you really believe in
him, you ought not to doubt him under
any possible circumstances." Then Polly
bit her lips and calmed down somewhat,
for Mollie was looking a little frightened
as she always did when her sister and
Billy disagreed. However, her sympathies
this time were assuredly on her sister's
side.</p>

<p>"If you had only belonged to a Camp
Fire club as we did with Betty Ashton
you would never have doubted her even
for a second, Billy. I know you don't
really," Mollie added, somewhat severely
for her. "Oh, dear, I never shall cease
to be grateful for our club! All the girls
seem almost like sisters to me, and especially
Betty."</p>

<p>Billy Webster folded up his paper and
glanced first at his wife and then at his
sister-in-law.</p>

<p>"I beg everybody's pardon," he said
slowly, "and I stand rebuked! Certainly
I did not mean really to doubt either<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Anthony or Betty for a moment. But
you are right, Mollie dear, that Camp
Fire Club certainly taught you girls loyalty
toward one another. I don't believe people
dare say nowadays that women are not
loyal friends, and perhaps the Camp Fire
clubs have had their influence. But some
day soon I believe I will go up to Concord
and see Anthony. Perhaps he might like
to talk to an old friend."</p>

<p>"He and Betty and the children are
coming to Woodford for Christmas," Mollie
announced contentedly, whipping away at
the lace on the doll's dress now that peace
was again restored. "Betty says she can't
miss the chance of spending a Christmas
with Polly after all these years. Besides,
she is curious about Bobbin. I hope
Sylvia will come too. She won't promise
to leave her old hospital, but I believe the
desire to see Polly will bring her here. You
know she writes, Polly, that you are positively
not to come to her for the present."</p>

<p>Her sister nodded, but a few moments
later got up and went up alone to her own
room.</p>

<p>Their talk had somehow made her feel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
more uncomfortable about Betty than she
had in the beginning. Somehow she had
hoped that Mollie would not be so ready
to agree with her own judgment. Yet
most decidedly she had noticed a change
in Betty during her short visit to her.
Betty was no longer gay and sweet-tempered;
she was nervous and cross, sometimes
with her husband and children, now
and then with the two girls who were spending
the winter with her, Angelique Martins
and Faith Barton. Moreover, she had
gotten a good deal thinner, and though
she was as pretty as ever, sometimes looked
tired and discontented. Besides, she was
living such a society existence, teas, balls,
dinners, receptions almost every hour of
the day and night. No wonder she was
tired! Of course Anthony could not always
go with her; he was far too busy and had
never cared for society. For a moment
Polly wondered when Betty and her husband
managed to see each other when
they were both so occupied with different
interests. Yet when they had married
she had believed them absolutely the most
devoted and congenial of all her friends.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, Betty need not expect finally to
escape confessing her difficulty. Even if
there was no opportunity for an intimate
talk during the Christmas gayeties they
must see each other soon again. Either she
would go to Concord or have Betty come
again to Mollie's.</p>

<p>Then Polly cast off her worries and settling
herself comfortably in a big leather
chair by the fire took out the letter concealed
inside her dress and began reading it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'><span class="smcap">Suspicion</span><br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>"ANGEL, will you go into Anthony's
private office; he told me he
wanted to speak to you," Betty
Graham said carelessly one afternoon in
December. She was dressed for driving in
a long fur coat and small black velvet hat
which brought out the colors in her auburn
hair in the most attractive fashion.</div>

<p>However, her expression changed as she
saw the girl to whom she had just spoken
turn white and clasp the railing of the banister
as if to keep herself from falling.</p>

<p>"What on earth is the matter with you,
Angel?" she demanded crossly. "You look
like you were going to faint when I deliver
a perfectly simple message. Surely you
are not afraid of Anthony after living here
with us all this time and working for him
even longer. I suppose he just wants to
speak to you about some business in connection
with the office. He never talks of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
anything else." Then a little ashamed of
her impatience, Betty put her arm on
Angel's shoulder.</p>

<p>"There has been something on your
mind recently, hasn't there, Angel, something
you have not cared to confide to me?"
She stopped, for her remark was half a
statement and half a question.</p>

<p>However, Angel nodded agreement.</p>

<p>"Well, I am sorry, but I don't seem to be
worthy of any one's confidence these days,"
Betty continued, trying to speak lightly.
"However, if any one wishes to know
where I have gone, dear, please say that
Meg Emmet and I are driving together and
that we are to have tea with old Professor
Everett." And the next moment Betty
Graham had disappeared down the steps.</p>

<p>Still Angel stood in the same place and
in the same position.</p>

<p>Surely Betty was being kept in the dark
if she did not dream of the trouble that had
been hovering over the Governor's office for
several weeks. Several important state
papers had been misplaced, lost or stolen.
No one knew what had become of them,
yet on them a great deal depended. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
were the proof that the Governor required
for exposing certain men whom he believed
dishonest. It was absolutely necessary
that they should be found.</p>

<p>Summoning her courage, Angel knocked
timidly at the Governor's study door. It
was in front of this same door that she had
watched the guests at the Inaugural Ball
some weeks before. Of course it was
absurd for her to be frightened at the Governor's
having sent for her. She was too
insignificant a person even to be questioned
in regard to the lost papers, as she
was only one of the unimportant stenographers
at the Capitol and was only occasionally
asked to do any of the Governor's
private work.</p>

<p>Anthony was sitting with his desk littered
with papers when Angel walked timidly
in. She thought he looked rather old
and tired and stern for so young a man.
But he was always very polite and at once
got up and offered her a chair.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to disturb you out of office
hours like this, Angel," he began kindly.
"I know it is Saturday afternoon and a half
holiday, but I thought perhaps we could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
talk something over better here at home
than at the office. One is so constantly
interrupted there."</p>

<p>Angel made a queer little noise in her
throat which she believed to have sounded
like "Yes."</p>

<p>Of course the Governor was going to
dismiss her from her position. She was not
a particularly good stenographer, not half
so fast as many of the girls, although she
had tried to be thorough. But then she
had no real talent for office work and of
course there was no reason why she should
continue to hold her position because she
was a friend of the family. Positively
Angel was beginning to feel sorry for the
Governor's embarrassment and already had
made up her mind to try and get some other
kind of work. She would not stay on
and be dependent.</p>

<p>Anthony was tapping his desk with his
pencil.</p>

<p>"See here, Angel," he said, "I wonder if
you by any chance have the faintest idea
of what has become of some papers we have
been a good deal worried about at the
office. I know you don't often have anything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
to do with my private business, but
I thought by accident you might have seen
them lying around at some time. They
were two or three letters bound around with
a blue paper and a rubber band. Know
anything about them?"</p>

<p>The girl started. For suddenly the Governor's
manner had changed and he was
looking at her sternly out of his rather cold,
searching eyes. For a man does not win his
way to greatness through all the trials that
Anthony Graham had endured without
having some streak of hardness in him.</p>

<p>Quietly Angel shook her head, but she
was neither nervous nor offended by the
Governor's questioning. She had heard the
gossip, strictly within the office, of the loss
of these letters and it was most natural that
every member of the force should be investigated
concerning them.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," she answered, her voice
trembling the least little bit in spite of her
efforts, "but I have never at any time seen
anything of the letters you mention. Could
it be possible that one of the servants at the
Capitol realized their importance and stole
them in order to get money for them?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," the Governor answered promptly,
"that is not possible, because the letters
were taken from this study and in this house.
Think again, Angel, have you seen nothing
of them? There is no one else living in the
house here, you know, who works at my
office except you."</p>

<p>Angel jumped quickly to her feet. "You
don't mean&mdash;you can't mean," she began
chokingly. "Oh, I can't bear it! I shall
tell Betty&mdash;she will never believe. Why, I
thought you were my best friends, almost
my only friends." For a moment she found
it impossible to go on.</p>

<p>But the Governor was looking almost as
wretched as she was herself. "My dear,
I don't mean really to accuse you of anything,
remember. I am only asking you
questions. And I particularly beg of you
not to mention this trouble of ours to
Betty. She is not very well at present and
I am afraid she thinks I am too hard on all
her friends. Indeed, I am sure I should
never have dreamed of you in connection
with this matter, but that some one in whom
I have great confidence told me that he had
seen you coming out of my study on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
night on which I believe my papers were
mislaid. We won't talk about the matter
any more for the present, however. Possibly
the letters will yet turn up, and it has
been only my own carelessness that is responsible
for the loss. There, do go up to
your own room and lie down for a while,
Angel. I assure you this conversation has
been as distasteful to me as it has to you.
It was only because the discovery of these
letters is so important that I decided to talk
to you. But don't think I am accusing
you."</p>

<p>Sympathetically and apologetically the
Governor now smiled at his companion, the
smile that had always changed his face so
completely from a grave sternness to the
utmost kindness and charm.</p>

<p>But Angel would not be appeased. She
had always a passionate temper inherited
from her Latin ancestors, though she usually
kept it well under control.</p>

<p>"You mean your private secretary, Kenneth
Helm, has suggested that you question
me," she announced bitterly. "I
knew he disliked me for some reason or
other, but I did not know his dislike was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
as cruel as this. It was he who saw me
sitting out here watching the people down-stairs
the night of your Inaugural Ball,
because I was too shy to go down alone."
For an instant it occurred to Angel to
say that she had seen Kenneth Helm enter
the Governor's private study on this same
evening. But what would have been the
use? The Governor probably knew of it
and certainly he had the utmost faith in
his secretary. It would only look as if
she were trying to be spiteful and turn
the suspicion upon some one else. Besides,
had she not promised Kenneth Helm not
to tell? At least she would not condescend
to break her word.</p>

<p>Stumbling half blindly, Angel made her
way out of the study. In the hall she
found Bettina waiting for her.</p>

<p>"You promised to come and play more
secret with me. Will you come now,
Angel? We can go up to the nursery
and lock the door; there is no one to find
us," Tina urged.</p>

<p>But Angel could only shake her head,
not daring to let the little girl see into
her face.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, outside her own bedroom
door she had to meet an even greater
strain upon her nerves. For there stood
Faith Barton in a pretty house dress and
with a box of candy in her hands.</p>

<p>"May I come in and talk to you for a
little while, Angel?" she asked, hesitating
the least little bit. "Kenneth has just
sent me a note and a box of candy, saying
that he cannot keep his engagement with
me tonight. He is so dreadfully busy,
poor fellow! I don't believe Governor
Graham works one-half so hard. So I
thought maybe you would let me stay
with you, as I am rather lonely. Besides,
Angel, there isn't any sense in your treating
me so coldly as you have lately. If
I am doing wrong in keeping my engagement
a secret, I am doing wrong, that's
all. But I don't think you ought to be
unkind to me. If I have been hateful to
you about anything, truly I am sorry.
You know I have always been awfully
fond of you, dear, and wanted to be your
friend ever so much more than you ever
wished to be mine."</p>

<p>But instead of answering Faith, the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
girl had to push by her almost rudely,
stammering:</p>

<p>"I can't talk to you now, Faith. I've
got the headache. I'm not very well;
I must lie down."</p>

<p>Then with Faith standing almost on her
threshold, resolutely Angel closed the door
in her face.</p>

<p>If there was one person above all others
at this moment with whom she could not
bear to talk it was Faith Barton.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'><span class="smcap">Waiting to Find Out</span><br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>AS the days passed on, the little
French girl did not find her difficulties
grow less. At the office
she continued to hear veiled discussions
of the seriousness of the lost letters. No
one, of course, except a few persons in
the Governor's confidence, knew exactly
what information the letters contained, but
there was no question of their political
importance, for everybody could feel the
atmosphere of strain and suspense. Yet
for one thing at least Angelique Martins
was grateful: no one had in any way
associated her with the lost or stolen
papers. For whatever Kenneth Helm suspected,
or Governor Graham feared, they
had both kept their own counsel. Yet
this did not mean that they both considered
her guiltless.</div>

<p>Time and time again Angel tried to
summon courage to speak directly to Kenneth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Helm on the subject. She had frequent
opportunities, for even if there was
danger of notice or interruption at the
office, he came very often to the Governor's
mansion to see Faith or to dine
with the family.</p>

<p>However, she simply did not know what
to do or say. To go to Kenneth and ask
him why he had accused her seemed to
the girl almost like a confession of wrongdoing.
For oftentimes it appears preposterous
in this world to be forced into
denying an act that one could never have
even dreamed of committing. How can
one suddenly say, "I am <i>not</i> a thief, I
am <i>not</i> a liar," when every thought and
act of their lives has been pure and good?</p>

<p>Neither could Angel persuade herself to
tell Kenneth Helm that she felt just as
suspicious of him as he could possibly feel
of her. For she had no proof of any kind
except her own dislike and distrust and
the fact that she had seen him coming
out of the Governor's private study on
the same night on which he had suggested
that she might have previously entered it.
For of course the Governor's private secretary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
had a right to his chief's private
papers at almost all times. No, Kenneth
would only consider her accusation an
expression of feeble revenge and be perhaps
more convinced of her guilt in
consequence.</p>

<p>Therefore there was nothing to do but
wait with the hope that everything would
soon be cleared up and the lost letters
either found or their thief discovered.</p>

<p>Moreover, Angel was not even to have
the satisfaction of talking the matter over
with Betty, the one person in the world
who could and would have helped her.
For she had the Governor's strict command
against this and did not dare disobey.
Besides, Angel could see that Betty was
unlike herself these days and so should
not be troubled by any one else's trials.
This, of course, was a mistaken point of
view, as nothing would so have helped
Betty Graham at this time as to have
had some one to think about who really
needed her. However, neither her friend
nor her husband could have realized this.</p>

<p>Nevertheless there was one consolation
that the little French girl enjoyed during<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
these days and that was "the secret"
which she and Bettina had been cherishing
so ardently for weeks. Every spare
hour she had from her work she and
Bettina had spent together in a big room
at the top of the house, which was Bettina's
own private play-room, sacred to her
uses only.</p>

<p>It was a lovely room with pale gray
walls and warm, rose-colored curtains, and
all about were pictures of girls and boys
who had come straight out of fairyland
and had their photographs taken by such
wonderful fairy artists as Maxfield Parish
and Elizabeth Shippen Greene.</p>

<p>For you see Angelique was absolutely
attempting to draw one of these fairy
pictures herself, while Bettina was acting
as her model.</p>

<p>The picture was not to be a portrait,
the artist had scarcely courage to have
undertaken that, but it was to represent
Bettina's favorite heroine, "Snow White
and Rose Red."</p>

<p>All her life, ever since she was a little
girl of five or six, Angelique Martins had
been drawing and painting whenever she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
had the least chance or excuse. Of course
it was this same artistic gift that had
showed in her clever fingers and sense of
color through all the work which she had
done in the Camp Fire Club. But of her
actual talent as an artist Angelique had
always been extremely shy. You see, she
cared for art so much that she did not
consider that she had any <i>real</i> talent.
But even confessing that she had the
least little ability, of course it would take
years of study and goodness knows how
much money before she could have hoped
to amount to anything.</p>

<p>Nevertheless there was nothing to forbid
the little lame French girl's amusing
herself with her fancy whenever she had
the chance. And ever since she could
remember, Angel had been drawing pictures
for Bettina. It had been their favorite
amusement as soon as Tina passed beyond
her babyhood, which was sooner than
most children.</p>

<p>Naturally Angel had drawn hundreds of
pictures with Bettina as her model before,
but never one half so ambitious as this.
However, this last one represented about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the sixth effort, and it was a great question
even now whether this was to be the
final one. For "Snow White and Rose
Red" was not merely a play picture, one
that had been painted merely for amusement;
it had a most serious intention
behind it.</p>

<p>Weeks before in a magazine which the
two friends had been looking over together
they had come across an advertisement.
A prize of two hundred dollars was offered
for the best picture illustrating any fairy
story. Moreover, no well-known artist was
to be allowed to enter the competition; the
drawings were all to be made by amateurs
under twenty-five years of age.</p>

<p>The first suggestion that Angel should
take part in this wonderful contest had
come, of course, from Bettina as soon as
the older girl had read her the amazing
announcement, for Tina's faith in her
friend was without limit. Then just as
naturally Angel first laughed at her suggestion
and afterwards decided to try just
for fun to see what she could do; and
here at last was most furiously in earnest,
although still undecided whether to send<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
her picture to the competition or to throw
it away.</p>

<p>There were only a few days more before
the time limit expired. Therefore, would it
be possible for her to undertake an entirely
new picture here at the very last?</p>

<p>With these uncertainties weighing on her
mind Angel was sitting in front of a small
easel with a box of pastels on a table near
by. Closer to the big nursery window
Bettina was curled up in a white armchair,
one foot tucked up under her in a favorite
attitude and in her lap were half a dozen
red roses.</p>

<p>She was tired, for she had been quiet
an unusually long time while Angel made
slight changes in her work and then stopped
to consider the whole thing disparagingly.
But somehow her weariness made Bettina's
pose even more charming.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 317px;"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>
<img src="images/i167.png" width="317" height="500" alt="Angel Had Caught Bettina&#39;s Attitude Almost Exactly" title="" />
<span class="caption">Angel Had Caught Bettina&#39;s Attitude Almost Exactly</span>
</div>

<p>Her long yellow-brown hair hung over
her shoulders down into her very lap, her
eyes were wide open and yet were plainly
not looking at any particular object. For
Tina was making up stories to amuse
herself while Angel worked. It was only
in this way that she could manage to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
keep still for so long a time as Angel
needed.</p>

<p>But this was the picture that Bettina
herself made; what of her friend's drawing
of her? Naturally it was not so graceful
or pretty as the little girl herself.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, by some happy chance
Angel had caught Bettina's attitude almost
exactly. Then too she had drawn a little
girl who did not look exactly like other
children. There was a suggestion of poetry,
almost of mystery, about her fairy tale
girl, in the wide open blue-gray eyes,
dreaming as Tina's so often were, and in
the half uncurled lips.</p>

<p>Of course the lines of the drawing were
not so firm and clear as an experienced
artist would have made them, yet glancing
at the little picture, you felt something
that made you wish to look at it
again.</p>

<p>However, Angel sighed so that Bettina
came out of her dream story and stretched
herself in the big chair.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" she inquired.
"May I get up and walk about the room
now?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>The older girl nodded. "Thank you,
dear. This is the last time I am going
to trouble you to sit for this picture. I
have just decided that I can't do any
better by trying it over again, yet I don't
know whether I shall send it to the competition
after all."</p>

<p>The next moment Angel was startled
by something that sounded almost like a
sob from Tina. Since the little girl was
so seldom cross, she was surprised and a
little frightened.</p>

<p>"I am sorry you are so tired. Why
didn't you tell me?" Angelique demanded.</p>

<p>Bettina had crossed the nursery and
was standing close beside her picture.</p>

<p>"It isn't that, it is only that I do want
you to send it so much," Bettina answered.
"You see, I think it is the best picture
anybody ever painted and we have both
worked so hard and it has been such a
nice secret," she said huskily.</p>

<p>Angel put her arm about her. "Of
course I'll send it, dear, if you feel that
way," she conceded. "But you must not
even dream that I shall get the prize
and you must promise not to be disappointed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
if we never hear of the picture
again."</p>

<p>Bettina agreed and then there followed
a most unexpected knocking at the locked
nursery door. The two conspirators stared
at each other in consternation.</p>

<p>"Who is it, please?" Bettina demanded.
"You know Angel and I are having our
secret together and we can't let any one
come in."</p>

<p>Betty's voice replied: "Yes, I know;
but I thought maybe the secret was over
and you would like me to come and play
too. I am feeling pretty lonesome."</p>

<p>"Oh," Tina returned, and then she and
Angel whispered together. Finally the
little girl came over toward the closed
door.</p>

<p>"I wish you would not be lonesome just
now, mother," she murmured, "just when
we are most dreadfully busy. If you
will only go away for a little while and
then come back, why, Angel and I will
love to play with you."</p>

<p>"I am afraid I won't be here after a
while," Betty answered and then walked
slowly away. It was absurd for her to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
feel wounded by such a trifle, and yet
recently it had looked as though Bettina
preferred Angelique's company to hers.
What a useless person she was growing
to be! Well, at least she and Meg were
going to a Suffrage meeting that afternoon!
She had not intended going, but
the baby was asleep and Anthony would
not be home for hours. Perhaps after
the talk ended she might drive by and
get Anthony to return with her. She had
not thought him looking very well that
morning.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'><span class="smcap">A Talk That Was Not an Explanation</span><br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>THE Suffrage meeting was fairly interesting,
but then both Meg and
Betty had been believers in equal
rights for men and women ever since their
Camp Fire days and there were few new
arguments to be heard on the subject.</div>

<p>When they came out from the crowded
hall, however, it was still too early to call
for Anthony. There could be no hope of
getting hold of him before half-past five
o'clock. So it was Meg Emmet's suggestion
that she and Betty stop by and see her
father for a few moments. Professor
Everett had a slight cold and his daughter
was a little uneasy about him.</p>

<p>They found the old gentleman in his
library sipping hot tea and re-reading a
letter from his son, Horace, whom Betty
could not ever think of by any more serious
name than "Bumps." She always saw a
vision of the small boy dragging around at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
his sister Meg's heels and tumbling over
every object in their way. However,
"Bumps" had grown up to be a very clever
fellow and had a better record at college
than his brother John ever had. The young
man was to graduate in law at Cornell in
the coming spring. The present letter was
to say, however, that he expected to spend
Christmas in Concord with his father. He
had been doing some tutoring at Cornell and
had earned the money for his trip himself.</p>

<p>Plainly Professor Everett was much
pleased by this news. He had always been
a devoted father to all his three motherless
children, but Horace was his "Benjamin."</p>

<p>Moreover, they were still talking of
"Bumps" when unexpectedly John Everett
made his appearance. He was looking
rather fagged, but explained that there
was nothing going on at his office and so he
had quit for the day.</p>

<p>Nevertheless tea had a reviving effect
upon him, as it had upon both Meg and
Betty, so that Betty was surprised to discover
that it was twenty minutes past five
o'clock when her visit seemed scarcely to
have begun.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>It was quite dark, however, as it was
toward the middle of December when the
days are short, so that John Everett insisted
upon accompanying his sister and
friend, even though they were in Betty's
carriage.</p>

<p>Meg's home was nearer. They drove
there first and later John went on to the
Capitol, where Betty sent in to inquire
if the Governor were free to return home
with her.</p>

<p>There was a little time to wait before the
answer came, so that in the meanwhile
Betty and John continued talking.</p>

<p>It was Betty who asked the first important
question.</p>

<p>"I do hope, John, that your new business
is succeeding," she said carelessly, although
of course she felt a friendly interest in John's
success and in that of Meg's husband.</p>

<p>However, John Everett hesitated a moment
before replying.</p>

<p>"Oh, our success depends on your Governor
and so perhaps on you," he answered
in a half joking tone. "I don't know
whether you happen to have heard anything
about it, but we are trying to get a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
bill through the Legislature this season
which will give us the chance to build the
new roads in the state of New Hampshire
for the next few years. But we don't know
just yet how the Governor feels about it,
whether he is going to oppose our bill or
work with us. He has a big lot of influence."</p>

<p>"Oh," Betty replied vaguely. She sincerely
hoped that John Everett was not
going to try persuade her to ask her husband
to assist him for the second time. Surely
if he did she would refuse. For in the first
place she did not wish to confess that she
believed herself to have no real influence
with her husband and in the second she
wouldn't try to interfere in anything so
important as a bill to be gotten through
the Legislature unless she knew everything
about it. Formerly she had taken an
intense interest in all the political affairs
that interested her husband, yet recently
Anthony had not been discussing matters
with her very often. Moreover, she had a
sudden feeling that she did not wish to be
mixed up again with John Everett's concerns.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>So fortunately before Betty had a chance
to reply Anthony came down the length of
stone steps to his wife's carriage.</p>

<p>He seemed pleased at seeing her, but not
very enthusiastic over her companion.</p>

<p>However, John Everett said good-bye
and left at once.</p>

<p>They had only fairly started on the
road toward home when Anthony said
suddenly:</p>

<p>"I do wish, Betty, that you would not be
seen so often with John Everett. Oh, I
know you don't realize it, but it seems to
me that you are very often with him. I
know he is Meg's brother and that you are
devoted friends, but I tell you I don't like
the fellow. The more I know him, the less
I like him. So I simply won't have my
wife in his society."</p>

<p>Betty caught her breath and her cheeks
flushed hotly in the darkness. How unkind
Anthony was to her these days! Could it be
possible that he did not love her any more?
He certainly could not be jealous of John
Everett; that idea was too absurd to be
considered. For she never had cared for
any one in her life except her husband and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
he must know it. However, she had no
intention of being bullied.</p>

<p>"Don't be silly, Anthony," Betty replied
petulantly. "I don't see very much of John
Everett. Besides, if I did what difference
would it make? Of course, if you know
anything actually against him you would
tell me?"</p>

<p>"So you no longer wish to do things just
because I wish them? I'm sorry, Betty,"
Anthony returned. Then they drove the
rest of the way home in silence, both behaving
like sullen children in spite of the fact
that they were entirely grown-up people,
the Governor of the state and his clever
and charming wife.</p>

<p>For the truth was that Anthony Graham
was jealous of John Everett and yet was
ashamed to speak of it. He would never
have dreamt of such a feeling if only he
and Betty had not been estranged for the
past few weeks. Besides, he was missing
the opportunity to spend as much time
with her as he formerly had before his
election to office. Surely Betty must understand
that. How could he help hating
to have another fellow drinking tea with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
her on any number of afternoons when he
was slaving at his office&mdash;especially a
man like John Everett?</p>

<p>Oh, of course Anthony realized that this
was rather a dog-in-the-manger attitude on
his part and that he ought to laugh over it
with his wife.</p>

<p>Moreover, if he had, Betty would have
understood and forgiven him. She might
even have been a little pleased, since she
believed that Anthony did not miss the loss
of her society half so much as she had the
loss of his. If he had even told her the
special reason he had for disliking John
Everett doubtless she would have been convinced,
in spite of her natural loyalty to
her old friends.</p>

<p>But Anthony did not even do this. He
had an idea that he was saving Betty trouble
by not telling her of the loss of the papers by
which he could prove that the bill which
ex-Governor Peyton, Jack Emmet and
John Everett were trying to get through
the Legislature was an effort to cheat the
state.</p>

<p>Yet in consequence Betty cried herself
into a headache and was therefore unable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
to come down to dinner, while Anthony
decided that she would not come simply
because she was too angry with him.</p>

<p>So can people in this world manage to
misunderstand each other, even after they
have been married a number of years and
are very deeply and truly in love with each
other.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'><span class="smcap">Christmas</span><br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>STILL unreconciled, Anthony and Betty
went together to spend their Christmas
with Mrs. Ashton in Woodford
in the old Ashton homestead. They took
with them both Bettina and Tony and the
nurse and Faith Barton. However, Faith
was of course to stay with her foster
parents, Doctor and Mrs. Barton.</div>

<p>Only Angel refused to accompany the
little party. She claimed not to be feeling
well, to have some business that she must
attend to, and indeed made so many excuses
that Betty, seeing that she really did
wish to be left behind, gave up arguing the
matter with her. Moreover, Meg promised
to look after Angel and see that she had her
Christmas dinner with them, so that she
would not be particularly lonely.</p>

<p>It was in Angel's mind that perhaps
during the family's absence something might
occur which would relieve her from all suspicion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
in the Governor's sight. Yet if she
thought that this would come about through
Kenneth Helm she was mistaken, for Kenneth
departed for Woodford on Christmas
eve to spend the following day with Faith
and her parents.</p>

<p>Besides seeing her mother and giving her
children the pleasure of a country Christmas
Betty was chiefly looking forward to
being with Polly. Somehow she felt that
Polly would be sure to cheer her up and
make her feel young again. They could
take long walks through the woods and discover
whether little Sunrise Cabin was still
habitable. Billy and Mollie had always
looked after it, carefully attending to whatever
repairs were necessary, so doubtless
it was as good as new.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it was extremely difficult
after her arrival for Betty and Polly to find
time for the intimate hours that they both
longed to have together, for there were so
many other people about&mdash;old friends and
relatives.</p>

<p>Nan Graham came from Syracuse, where
she had charge of the department of domestic
science in the High School, in order to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
with her brother Anthony, whom she had
not seen since his election.</p>

<p>Edith Norton with her husband and four
children still lived in Woodford and claimed
the intimacy of their Camp Fire days. Then,
of course, there was Herr Krippen and Mrs.
Krippen and Betty's small stepbrother
to be considered, besides Mr. and Mrs.
Wharton, Eleanor and Frank.</p>

<p>But perhaps the most important and unexpected
member of the Christmas gathering
was the distinguished and eccentric
Doctor Sylvia Wharton. Certainly it was
Sylvia who kept Betty and Polly from being
alone with each other during her own brief
visit.</p>

<p>The morning of the day before Christmas
Mollie got a letter from Sylvia, who
had charge of a hospital in Philadelphia,
saying that much as she regretted it she
would be unable to spend Christmas with
them.</p>

<p>During the late afternoon Polly, who had
escaped from the noise and confusion going
on inside Mollie's big house, was taking a
walk up and down the bare wind-swept
orchard to the left of the house. The ground<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
was covered with hard white snow and the
air stung with a kind of delicious cold
freshness.</p>

<p>It was a part of Polly's regular duty to
stay out of doors for a certain number of
hours each day, so she now stopped her
walk for a moment and glanced ahead at
some almost blue-black pine trees silhouetted
against the twilight sky.</p>

<p>Suddenly she became conscious of what
sounded like a masculine step behind her, and
before she could turn around felt her two
arms firmly grasped by a pair of capable
hands and herself swung slowly about.</p>

<p>She faced a figure not so tall as her own,
but broader, stronger and far more sturdy.
The blue eyes looked at her through a pair
of spectacles, the flaxen hair was parted in
the middle and without the least sign of a
crinkle drawn straight back on either side.
The mouth was firm, but curiously kind.
And just now it actually showed signs of
trembling.</p>

<p>"Why, Sylvia Wharton!" Polly said and
straightway hid her face in the fur of her
stepsister's long coat. Immediately she
had a feeling of dependence on Sylvia's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
judgment and affection just as she had for
so long a time, although she was several
years the older.</p>

<p>"Don't try to hide your face from me,
Polly O'Neill. I want to see how you are
looking before you get back into the house
and do your best to deceive me. I can
feel already that you are thin as a rail,"
Dr. Sylvia murmured severely. "You see
if I don't straighten you out before you go
back to that wretched work again!"</p>

<p>"It was good of you to come, Sylvia; I
was so disappointed over your letter this
morning. Only I am not your patient,
dear; I am quite all right. It is 'Bobbin,'
my poor little girl, I want you to look after
and find somebody to help," Polly returned
with unaccustomed meekness.
"Really she is interesting and unusual.
Both Mollie and Billy Webster think so; it
isn't only my foolishness. I suppose you
thought my bringing her east with me was
rather mad, didn't you, Sylvia?"</p>

<p>Sylvia smiled the slow smile that had
always beautified her plain face. "No,
not mad, only Polly!" she answered dryly.
"But of course I'll look the little girl over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
for you, and then I'll find the best person
to see her and you can send her to me in
Philadelphia. Only don't think you are
going to escape by that method yourself."</p>

<p>On Christmas Eve all the grown-up members
of the Christmas party dined with Mrs.
Ashton and Betty in the town of Woodford,
since Mollie was to have the tree and Christmas
dinner for them and the children on
the farm the next day.</p>

<p>It was an amusing change from the past
to find that Anthony Graham and Sylvia
Wharton were really the lions of the evening.
How different it had been in the old
days when Anthony was only an awkward,
shabby, obscure boy and Sylvia the plainest
and most unprepossessing of the Sunrise
Hill Camp Fire girls!</p>

<p>Polly and Betty too, in spite of her
wounded feelings, were both immensely
pleased and amused by it.</p>

<p>Of course Sylvia would rather have died
than have mentioned the fact, but quite
by accident Anthony had read the previous
day of Sylvia's election as President of the
American Medical Society, the highest
honor that had ever been paid a woman in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
the medical profession in the United
States.</p>

<p>Hearing the story at the dinner table,
Sylvia was of course confused by the admiration
and applause it excited, for she was
still as shy and reserved about her own
accomplishments as she had ever been as
a young girl.</p>

<p>Moreover, it was Polly who recalled
having once predicted that Sylvia Wharton
would become the most distinguished of
the Camp Fire girls and who made a little
speech in her honor, much to the confusion
and disgust of Sylvia.</p>

<p>Then Billy Webster offered their congratulations
to Anthony, who was almost
equally modest about his own attainments
and insisted that his election as Governor
was due to a happy accident and not to any
possible ability of his own.</p>

<p>The Christmas day following was even
more crowded with people and excitement.
Actually Mollie and Billy were to have
thirty guests to dine at the farm at two
o'clock and the Christmas tree for the
children was to be given immediately after.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, Sylvia arranged to
spend an hour alone with Polly and Bobbin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
in a room at the top of the house where there
could be no interruption.</p>

<p>She appeared to be deeply interested in
Bobbin. She made Polly talk and then saw
how easily Bobbin seemed to be able to
understand. Then she asked questions
herself which now and then the little girl
was able to comprehend.</p>

<p>Polly explained that perchance Bobbin
understood her better than other people,
because of her training as an actress, which
of course required her to enunciate more
distinctly. However, Dr. Wharton made no
reply and after a time Bobbin was sent
away to watch the children at play.</p>

<p>Then Polly sat quietly in a big armchair,
while Sylvia strode up and down the room
with her hands clasped behind her. They
were both silent for quite five minutes.</p>

<p>Afterwards Sylvia spoke first.</p>

<p>"I am by no means sure your little girl
is entirely deaf, Polly," she remarked
abruptly. "But I am not an expert in the
matter and I don't want to trust my own
judgment. I believe she hears indistinctly
perhaps and so has never learned to talk.
Yet it would not surprise me if a sudden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
shock of some kind might make her hear,
and after that she would learn to talk
easily enough. But I'll discuss her case and
we can see about it later. Now you are to
let me look you over."</p>

<p>Of course Polly shrugged her shoulders
and objected, insisting that she was entirely
well and that it was absurd to waste Sylvia's
time.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as usual, Dr. Wharton had
her way and at the end of a half hour's
examination Polly appeared pale and exhausted,
while Sylvia looked more satisfied.</p>

<p>"You are not to go back on the stage
again this winter, Miss O'Neill," she announced
decisively. "But you really are in
better health than I expected to find you.
If you only would behave with a little more
sense!"</p>

<p>Polly sighed, waving her accuser away.</p>

<p>"Do go and let me rest now, please," she
commanded. "You know I have promised
to recite for the children for an hour or so
after dinner. And I do wish my friends
and family would stop asking me to behave
with better sense. How can I if I haven't got
it? Everybody ought to be sorry for me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>Smiling, Sylvia departed. It was like old
times to hear Polly talking in her old aggrieved
fashion when she knew herself to be
really in the wrong. But then Sylvia decided
that she would probably always love
Polly more than any one else in the world,
even if they saw each other so seldom. For
she never expected to marry herself and
doubted now whether Polly ever would.
There had been a scare years before about
a Richard Hunt, but as Polly never mentioned
his name now she must by this time
have forgotten him.</p>

<p>The Christmas dinner and tree were a
great success. After Polly had made the
children shriek with pleasure by playing a
dozen characters from Mother Goose, and
the older people cry by reciting several
exquisite Christmas poems by Whitcomb
Riley and Eugene Field, the guests then
sang Camp Fire songs until darkness
descended.</p>

<p>It was a pity, however, that Esther and
Dick and their children were in Boston and
unable to come home for the holidays, for
Esther's beautiful voice was sadly needed
in the music.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>But at six o'clock Sylvia was forced to
leave for Philadelphia, and so the other
guests decided that it was time that the
weary children should be taken home.</p>

<p>However, for one minute Polly and Betty
did manage to slip over into a corner and
in that moment made an engagement to
spend the whole of the next afternoon
together. Moreover, in order to get away
from every one else they planned to take a
long walk to Sunrise Cabin.</p>

<p>Nevertheless that same night each of
the two friends lay awake for several hours,
firmly resolving not to tell the other the
trouble that lay nearest their hearts. For
they both decided that they should have
gotten beyond their old girlhood confidences
and that there were certain things
women should keep to themselves.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'><span class="smcap">The Stupidity of Men</span><br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>"BUT, my dear, there isn't the least
use of your denying it. The fact
that you are unhappy is as plain
as the nose on your face. Of course if you
don't want to tell me the reason you need
not, but don't expect me to be so stupid as
not to see it," Polly concluded solemnly.</div>

<p>Actually the two friends were in the
time-honored old living room in Sunrise
Cabin. With their own hands they had
brought in twigs and logs from outdoors
and lighted an enormous fire in the big
fireplace. Then Polly had produced three
candles from her handbag and had stuck
them into the tarnished brass candlesticks
that were still ornamenting the mantel,
where they were now burning fitfully.</p>

<p>With their coats off both of the old
Camp Fire girls sat on rickety chairs before
the fire, their chins resting in their hands
and gazing none too happily into the flames.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I tell you, you are mistaken, Polly.
There is nothing the matter with me. Of
course one can't expect to be happy when
one grows older, as in our old irresponsible
Camp Fire days. Maybe it is old age that
is troubling me, for I am a most uninterestingly
healthy person."</p>

<p>In replying Betty tried to make her tones
as light as possible; nevertheless her companion
only frowned the more unbelievingly.</p>

<p>"Our Camp Fire days were never irresponsible
ones for me, Betty child," Polly
responded, gazing thoughtfully around the
dear, dismantled room. "Often I feel I
never learned so much at any other time in
my life as I did then. But the fact remains
that you are not happy as I want you to be,
and I wish with all my heart that you loved
me enough to tell me the reason why.
You see, Betty, I am rather a lonely, good-for-nothing
old maid and I can't expect
much for myself. But you have absolutely
everything in the world any woman could
wish. And I think it is positively wicked
of you not to be the same gay, sweet Betty."</p>

<p>At this Polly got out a small handkerchief<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
and began dabbing her Irish blue eyes, that
were shedding tears partly from the smoke
of the fire and partly from a general sense
of discouragement.</p>

<p>In return Betty stared back at her with
equal severity. "What a perfectly absurd
fashion for you to talk, Polly O'Neill!"
she replied. "You know perfectly well that
if you had chosen to marry you might have
had what I have. Only you didn't want to
marry; you wanted a career and to be famous
and to make money instead. Well,
haven't you succeeded? Is that what you
are crying about?"</p>

<p>Polly nodded. "I expect there isn't any
law about wanting everything, is there,
Betty Ashton Graham? So long as women
are women, no matter what they may try
to do or be, there will be times when they
cry for nice husbands and babies. But I
wasn't crying about me, it was about you,"
she continued ungrammatically and with
her usual logic. "Here you are growing
more beautiful every day you live. Everybody
loves you; you have hundreds of
friends, the two most fascinating children
in the world, except Mollie's, and a husband<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
who is about the best and cleverest man in
the state, and who simply adores you, and
yet you are wretched and cross and unlike
yourself. I watched you yesterday, Betty,
and you never smiled a single time when you
thought no one was looking and you never
once spoke to Anthony. The poor fellow
appeared dreadfully troubled too. Whatever
is the matter, I am much sorrier for
him than I am for you," Polly concluded
somewhat vindictively.</p>

<p>"Oh!" Betty faltered and then was so
silent that Polly humped her stool nearer
until her shoulder touched that of her friend.</p>

<p>"That last remark wasn't true, of course,
Betty," Polly apologized. "For if Anthony
is really a snake in the grass and treats
you badly when he looks so noble and kind,
why, I shall simply come to Concord and
tell him what I think of him right in the
Governor's mansion. I don't care whether
he puts me into the state prison or not."</p>

<p>Then, although she had been tremblingly
near tears herself the moment before,
Betty was compelled to laugh. Whoever
could do anything else in Polly O'Neill's
society? The thought of Anthony's thrusting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
a very noisy and protesting Polly into
prison was a picture to dispel almost any
degree of gloom.</p>

<p>Betty slipped her arm across her friend's
shoulder. "No, dear, you must not think
Anthony is unkind to me; it isn't that,"
she responded slowly. "Only I don't believe
he exactly 'adores' me as much as he
used to. Sometimes men get tired of their
wives."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, goose! What put that notion
in your head?" Polly returned lightly,
although she was a little frightened by her
friend's reply.</p>

<p>Really she had not believed that anything
could have come between Anthony
and Betty. Her suggestion had only been
made in order to induce Betty to deny it.
The next moment she leaned over and put
several fresh logs on the fire.</p>

<p>"Nothing and no one in this world could
ever persuade me, Betty dearest, that
Anthony does not adore you," Polly then
continued with convincing earnestness.
"You see, he began when you were sixteen
years old and he never knew that any other
girl lived in the world. He does not know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
it now, for he never even glanced at a single
one of us yesterday, if he could help it. But
you see Princess, dear, you are a good deal
spoiled. You always have been ever since
you were a baby, by your family and all
your friends. Even the Camp Fire Club
used to look up to you and be more devoted
to you than any one else. Esther has
always been your slave and now your little
French girl seems to feel about you just
as Esther used to do. Really, Betty, I
expect you need discipline."</p>

<p>Yet even as she spoke Betty's auburn
hair glistened with such exquisite colors in
the firelight that Polly stroked it softly with
her slender fingers.</p>

<p>The Governor's wife was thinking too
deeply to notice her.</p>

<p>"I wonder if things are my fault, Polly.
I almost hope they are," she answered
wistfully. "You see, it has seemed to me
lately that Anthony has been dreadfully
unreasonable. He won't do the things I
ask him to and though he is too busy to be
with me himself, he isn't willing for me to
spend much time even with my oldest
friends."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, ho!" whistled Polly softly. "What
friends, for instance, Princess?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Meg Emmet and&mdash;John Everett.
Isn't it absurd? But Anthony has always
felt a prejudice against John ever since we
were boys and girls together here in Woodford,"
Betty explained. "I don't care particularly
for John now myself. He has
grown kind of stupid and thinks too much
about what he eats, but it would look
utterly ridiculous of me to cut him for no
reason except that Anthony is absurd."</p>

<p>Polly dug her chin deeper into the palm
of her hand as she so often did in moments
of abstraction.</p>

<p>"Seems like a little enough thing to do if
Anthony wishes it and you could do it very
gracefully you know, Princess dear," Polly
replied. "Besides, I am not so sure Anthony
has no reason for his prejudice. I never
liked John Everett a cent myself when we
were all young. He was always trying to
lord it over the rest of us and pretend to
be very rich and grand and superior. Besides,
Betty Graham, I don't believe I
should care to have a husband who would
do every solitary thing I asked him to do.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Somehow, I think I would like him to have
a little judgment of his own now and then.
So you really wish Anthony to do exactly
as he is told. I wonder if your children are
as obedient? But come along, dear, it is
getting so late Mollie will be having fits
about us. Fortunately you are a more
sensible woman than I am. A perfectly
obedient husband is about the last thing
in this world I require. To what dreadful
end would I bring him!"</p>

<p>But Betty did not stir from her stool
even when her companion had crossed
over the room and now stood holding out
her long fur coat, waiting for her to put
her arms inside it.</p>

<p>"Dear, if there is one thing I am more
sure of at this moment than of anything
else, it is that I am not <i>so</i> sensible a
woman as Polly O'Neill. Though goodness
knows I never could have believed
it!" Betty whispered, laughing and yet
profoundly in earnest. "It was a most
excellent sermon and I mean to do my
best to profit by it. Truly I have been
behaving like a spoiled child for weeks.
I know Anthony has a great many things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
that trouble him and I ought to have been
more considerate. Somehow I expect this
marriage is really more the girl's business
than the man's. He has to make the
living for the family in most cases and
the Camp Fire taught us that home making
was a girl's highest privilege."</p>

<p>Then Betty got up and slipped on her
beautiful long coat and the two friends
started back toward Mollie's big farm
together.</p>

<p>In all their girlhood they had never
felt more intimate or more devoted. Yet
neither one of them talked much during
the long walk, just an occasional question
now and then.</p>

<p>The sun was going down, but there
was an after-glow in the sky and because
of the whiteness of the snow there was
still sufficient light. At least Polly and
Betty could see each other's faces with
perfect distinctness.</p>

<p>They had nearly reached the farm-house
when Betty suddenly stopped and
put both hands on Polly's shoulders.</p>

<p>"Look me directly in the eyes, Polly,"
she commanded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>And Polly attempted doing as she was
bid, but her lashes drooped until they
touched her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Have you fallen in love with some one
recently, Polly? Is that why you talked
about yourself in such a discouraged fashion
just now and lectured me so severely?"
Betty inquired.</p>

<p>Polly shook her head. "I don't know
whether you would call it falling in love
recently, Betty, or whether I have been
in love for the last ten years. But I saw
Richard Hunt again when I was in Colorado
and he was even nicer than he used to be.
He don't care a single thing about me any
more, Betty. He hasn't even sent me
a Christmas card! The letter I had from
him a few days ago was all about Bobbin.
He wasn't even interested enough to inquire
if I was well."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'><span class="smcap">A Cry in the Night</span><br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>BECAUSE she was tired from her
long walk and her conversation and
from other reasons Polly went up-stairs
to bed sooner than her sister and
brother-in-law.</div>

<p>As a special privilege the children had
begged that Bobbin should be allowed to
sleep in the nursery with them, and rather
against her will Polly had consented. The
little girl had previously occupied a small
room connected with her own.</p>

<p>However, she was too weary for argument,
and besides Mollie's babies were
cross and unreasonable. They had been
playing all afternoon with the Christmas
tree which stood in the big back
parlor just under Polly's room. Anything
to get them safely stowed in bed and
the house quiet!</p>

<p>For Polly had expected to lie awake
for a number of hours, reflecting on many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
things, when in point of fact immediately
after retiring she sank into a deep and
dreamless sleep.</p>

<p>Moreover, about ten o'clock Mollie and
Billy also decided to follow their sister's
example. And it was Billy himself who
closed up the windows and made the
house ready for the night. Only he failed
to go into the back parlor where the Christmas
tree stood and where the floor was now
littered with discarded toys and games and
the walls hung with dried-out evergreens.</p>

<p>He was under the impression that the
windows in this room had been closed
and locked when the children departed
to bed. Moreover, locking up at the
farm-house was more of a custom than a
necessity. No one had any real fear of
burglars or tramps. Besides, the windows
in the back parlor were locked and no
danger was to come from the outside.</p>

<p>But it must have been only about three
hours later when Mollie suddenly awoke
with a scream and start. A hand had
passed lightly over her face.</p>

<p>The next instant and Billy jumped up
and seized hold of the intruder.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet his hands clasped only a slight,
childish form in a white gown. It was
too dark in the room to see who it could
be until Mollie lit the candle which
stood always by their bedside.</p>

<p>Then they both discovered Bobbin, not
walking in her sleep as they supposed, but
with her face very white and making queer
little movements with her hands and lips.</p>

<p>"The child is frightened; something
must have to disturbed her," Billy suggested,
still only half awake himself.</p>

<p>But Mollie had jumped out of bed
and was already on her way to the
nursery. Naturally she presumed that
something had happened to one of the
children and that Bobbin had come to call
her. Poor little girl, she had no other way
of calling than to touch with her hands!</p>

<p>However, half way down the hall Mollie
turned and ran back into her own bedroom.</p>

<p>"Get up please, Billy, in a hurry, won't
you? I do believe I smell smoke somewhere
in the house. Something must be
on fire. Of course Bobbin could detect
it before the rest of us; she is sure to
have a keener sense of smell."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>A moment later and Billy had jumped
almost all the way down the long flight
of old-fashioned country stairs.</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened, dear, but get the
children up and put clothes on them," he
shouted back. "It is too cold for you to
go out in the snow undressed and we are
miles from a neighbor. I will call the men
and we will fight the fire. Don't forget
to waken Polly!"</p>

<p>With this last injunction in her mind
Mollie stopped to hammer on her sister's
door before she ran on to the nursery.</p>

<p>She was certain that she heard Polly
answer her. Besides, by this time the
house was filled with an excited tumult,
Mollie's little boys were dancing about
in the hall, half pleased and half frightened
with the excitement, their nurse was scolding
and crying and vainly endeavoring to
dress the small Polly.</p>

<p>So it was plain enough that for the next few
minutes Mollie had difficulty enough in keeping
her wits about her and in quieting her
family, especially as every now and then she
could hear her husband's voice from below
calling on her to hurry as quickly as possible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>Only Bobbin at once slipped into a
heavy, long coat and shoes and rushed
back to Polly's room. The door was
locked, but she pounded patiently and
automatically on the outside, unable, of
course, to hear the answering voice from
within.</p>

<p>Then there came a sudden hoarse shout
from below stairs and in that instant
Mr. Webster, dashing up a flight of steps
almost at one bound, returned with the
baby in his arms, while Mollie led one
of the small boys and the nurse the other.</p>

<p>"Come on, you and Polly, at once!"
Mollie cried, waving her hands and pointing
toward the great hall to show that
there was no time for further delay.</p>

<p>But this was evident enough to Bobbin
without being told, for the smoke was
pouring out of the parlor into the hall
and coming up the stairs like a great
advancing army.</p>

<p>However, Bobbin would not leave her
post. There was not the faintest thought
in her brain of ever stirring from without
that locked door until the one person whom
she loved in the world should come forth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
from it. And she was not conscious of
feeling particularly afraid, only she could
not understand why Miss O'Neill would
not hurry.</p>

<p>A moment later, however, and Bobbin
found herself outside standing alone in
the snow.</p>

<p>There had been no possible outcry on
her part, no explanation and no argument,
of course. Only when one of the farm
laborers rushing up-stairs had seen the
little girl loitering in the hall, without
saying by your leave, he had seized her
in his arms and borne her struggling through
the now stifling smoke.</p>

<p>Outside in the yard Bobbin for a moment
felt weak and confused. For all
at once the place seemed to be swarming
with excited people.</p>

<p>There were a dozen men and their families
living on the big farm with houses of their
own. And now the ringing of a great
bell had brought them all out with their
wives and children as well.</p>

<p>The women were swarming about Mollie
with their children, crying, gesticulating,
talking. It was a clear, white night and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Bobbin could see them easily. The men
were engaged in rushing back and forth
with pails of water, fearing that the water
might freeze on the way.</p>

<p>But there was nowhere any sign of
Polly!</p>

<p>Bobbin did not try to attract attention.
In the instant it did not even occur to
her that she might not have been able
to make any one understand. Simply
and without being seen she slipped into
one of the big front windows, opened by
the men as a passage-way, and started
fighting her way again up the black, smoke-laden
steps.</p>

<p>There seemed to be no more air, it was
all a thick, foggy substance that got into your
throat and made you unable to breathe and
into your eyes so that you could not see.
But Bobbin went resolutely on.</p>

<p>She clung to the banisters and dragged
herself upward, either too stupid or too
intent on her errand to suffer fear. Nevertheless,
through the smoke she could see
that long tongues of flame were bursting
out of the doors of the back parlor into
the hall beneath her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>Only, once more at Polly's bedroom door
Bobbin lost heart and the only real terror
she ever remembered enduring seized hold
on her. For Polly's door was still locked
and she had no means of making her hear.</p>

<p>All that she could accomplish by hammering
and kicking she had done before.
Of course, she tried this again, yet the
door did not open and so far as Bobbin
could know there was no movement from
the inside.</p>

<p>Yet next Miss O'Neill's room there was
her own room and the door of this was
unfastened. With a kind of half-blind
impulse Bobbin staggered into it. She
had no clear or definite idea of what she
intended doing, yet fortunately this room
was only partially filled with smoke so
that she could in a measure see her way
about.</p>

<p>There in the corner stood an old-fashioned,
heavy wooden chair. Almost
instinctively Bobbin seized hold on it.
She was curiously strong, doubly so to
any other girl of her age, since she had
lived outdoors always like a little barbarian.
Besides, there was nothing else<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
that could be done. She must break down
Miss O'Neill's door.</p>

<p>With all her force the girl hurled the
heavy chair against the oak door. There
were a few marks on its surface, yet the
door remained absolutely firm, for the
Webster house had been built in the days
when wood had been plentiful in the New
Hampshire hills and homes had been expected
to endure.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Bobbin pounded again and
again, almost automatically her thin arms
seemed to work, and yet all her effort
was without avail.</p>

<p>During these moments no one can guess
exactly what emotions tore at the girl's
heart. If only she could have cried out
her alarm and her desire, surely she would
have been answered!</p>

<p>Bobbin's face worked strangely, there
was a kind of throbbing in her ears and her
lips moved. "Polly!" she called in a
hoarse little whisper, and this was the
first word she had ever spoken in her life.</p>

<p>Inside in her smoke-filled room Polly
O'Neill could not possibly have heard her.
For the past fifteen minutes, during all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the excitement due to the fire, she had
been lying upon her bed in a stifled condition.
For no one had realized that as
Polly's room was immediately above the
back parlor, where the fire had been
smouldering ever since the children had
gone up-stairs to bed, her room had been
first to be filled with smoke. Yet the
smoke had come so slowly, so gradually
as she lay in a kind of exhausted sleep,
that she had been stupefied rather than
awakened by it.</p>

<p>Now was it the miracle rather than the
sound of Bobbin's speaking her name that
penetrated slowly to Polly's consciousness,
or was it the noise of the repeated pounding
of the heavy chair against her door?
Whatever the cause, she came back to
the world, choking, blinded, fighting with
her hands to keep off the black substance
that was crowding into her lungs.</p>

<p>Then somehow she managed to crawl
across her room, remembering that the
smoke would be denser higher up in the
atmosphere. Unlocking the door, she turned
the handle and Bobbin caught her as she
half fell into the hall.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>With a quick movement the girl put
her arm about the older woman's waist
and started for the stairway, for the hall
was dense with smoke and now and then
a tongue of flame leaped up from below
and seemed to dance for a moment in the
air about them.</p>

<p>It was overpowering, unendurable. Polly
was already dazed and exhausted and her
lungs were always delicate. At the top
of the stairs she became a dead weight
on her companion's arms. Besides, by
this time Bobbin too was very weary.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'><span class="smcap">The Discovery</span><br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>A &nbsp; FEW moments after Bobbin's disappearance
inside the house Mollie
O'Neill had suddenly torn herself
away from the people closed about her in
their effort to hide from her eyes the possible
destruction of her home.</div>

<p>She looked searchingly around her.</p>

<p>"Polly!" she called, "Polly!" For the
first moment since the fire started, she
seemed to be losing her self-control. For
all at once it had come to her in a terrifying
flash that she had not caught a glimpse of her
sister since the moment when she had gone
up-stairs at eight o'clock to retire to bed.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Polly must be somewhere
near by. She must have heard her calling
and she had had plenty of time to escape,
more than any one else, as she had no one
else to look after save herself. Yet it was
not like Polly not to have come at once to
her aid with the children!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>Mollie ran here and there about the yard,
still crying out her sister's name, horror
and conviction growing upon her at every
step.</p>

<p>At last she caught sight of her husband
directing half a dozen men and caught hold
of his arm.</p>

<p>"Billy, Polly is still inside the house,
locked in her own room. Don't ask me
how I know it, I do. We have got to go
in and get her." And Mollie started
quickly toward the front porch, until her
husband flung his arms about her.</p>

<p>"Wait here, Mollie," he said sternly.
"You will do no good, only make things
harder for me. If Polly is inside the house,
as you say, I'll have her out in a jiffy."</p>

<p>Then he called to one of the men. "Keep
Mrs. Webster here. On no account let
her follow me," he commanded, and glancing
about in every direction as he ran, he too
made for the house.</p>

<p>Assuredly Mollie was right. Neither
had he gotten even a passing glimpse of
Polly since the alarm of fire. But was it
going to be so simple a matter to rescue her
as he had pretended to his wife? For<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
certainly if Polly had heard nothing of the
tumult and danger surrounding her she
must be already hurt and unconscious.</p>

<p>Once inside his own hall Billy Webster
squared his great shoulders. The way
ahead of him now looked like a pathway of
flame and yet the smoke was harder to
endure than the heat. Nevertheless go
through it he must, since Polly's room lay
at the head of the stairs.</p>

<p>She must be saved. Billy had a sudden
vision of Polly from her girlhood until now;
her wilfulness, her charm and her great
talent. How stupidly he had opposed her
desire to be an actress in the days when he
had supposed himself in love with Polly
O'Neill instead of her twin sister! Well,
now they understood each other and were
friends and she should not come to grief
in his house.</p>

<p>In his pocket there was a wet handkerchief.
Indeed, all his clothes were fortunately
damp from the water that had
been splashed upon him in the work
outdoors. Quickly the man tied the handkerchief
about his mouth. Then he took
a few steps forward and paused. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
was a noise of something falling from above;
possibly some of the timbers of the old
house were beginning to give way. Could
they be under Polly's room?</p>

<p>But even while he thought, Billy Webster
fought his way deliberately forward until
he at last reached the bottom of the stairs
and then his feet struck something soft and
yielding. Stooping down, he caught up
two figures in his arms, not one!</p>

<p>For in that moment at the head of the
stairs when Polly had lost consciousness
Bobbin had managed to half carry, half
drag her on a part of the way. Then
realizing that her own strength was failing,
with instinctive good sense and courage she
had flung them both forward, so that they
both slid inertly down to the bottom of
the stairs.</p>

<p>Instantly and without feeling their weight
the man carried the woman and girl out of
doors.</p>

<p>Poor Bobbin, whom in these last terrible
moments they had forgotten! Yet she
it was who had remembered better than
them all!</p>

<p>Nevertheless, although both Polly and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Bobbin were unconscious, neither of them
was seriously burned. Yet Mollie was
dreadfully disturbed. Polly had come to
visit them on account of her health, and
there was no way of foretelling what effect
this night's experience might have upon her.
Here she was in her night dress, outdoors
in the cold, when the rest of them were
warmly clothed.</p>

<p>However, in another moment Polly was
comfortably wrapped in a long coat and
carried to the nearest house of one of the
farm assistants. Bobbin too was equally
well looked after, and as soon as she had
been in the fresh air for a few moments
the girl's breath had come back to her and
she was soon almost herself again.</p>

<p>Yet by this time all the women and
children had grown tired, for there was
nothing that they could do. Five minutes
before, Mollie's two boys and little girl and
nurse had been taken away and put to bed
by one of the farmer's wives. Moreover,
real assistance was arriving at last.</p>

<p>In the excitement some one had been
intelligent enough to get to the telephone
in the dining room before the fire had crept<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
in that direction. The town of Woodford
had promised to send help. Even now the
volunteer fire department of the village
with an engine and hose carriage was
trampling over the snow-covered lawns of
the old Webster homestead.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later a physician
appeared and also Betty and Anthony
Graham. Afterwards actually there were
dozens of Mollie's and Billy's friends who
drove out in their motor cars to take the
family home with them, or to do whatever
was possible for their relief and comfort.</p>

<p>By this time the fire in the old house
had been vanquished and the earth was
filled with the cold grayness of approaching
dawn.</p>

<p>Mollie would see no one but Betty, who
stayed on with her and the physician in the
room given up to Polly. Mrs. Wharton had
been persuaded not to come, and Anthony
Graham had gone back to town to make
things clear to her.</p>

<p>"It is just like Polly to be such a ridiculously
long time in coming to herself,"
Betty explained to her frightened friend.
"I don't think it means anything in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
least alarming." Yet all the time she was
wishing that the physician who held Polly's
thin wrist, counting her pulse, would not
look so deadly serious.</p>

<p>However, no matter what she might fear
herself, Mollie must be strengthened and
comforted. Her nerves had given way
under the recent strain and fright. It was
almost impossible for her to keep her teeth
from chattering and she was unable to
stand up. Notwithstanding, nothing would
persuade her to leave her sister's room.</p>

<p>"For if anything serious is the matter
with Polly, of course if will be my fault and
I shall never forgive myself," she would
repeat over and over. "You see, I forgot
Polly; it was only Bobbin who remembered."</p>

<p>Finally, however, there was a sign from
the doctor by Polly's bedside which Betty
managed to intercept. Without a word to
Mollie she slipped across the room to find
Polly's eyes wide open and staring in perplexity
at her.</p>

<p>"What on earth has happened, Betty?"
she demanded impatiently, although her
voice was so faint it was difficult to hear.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
"What are you and Mollie and I doing in
a room I never saw before, with me feeling
as if I had been out of the world and then
gotten only half-way back into it again?"</p>

<p>At the sound of her sister's voice
Mollie had also moved toward the bed.
She was distressingly white, her soft blue
eyes had dark circles around them and
she seemed utterly spent and exhausted.</p>

<p>Quickly Polly reached out her weak hand.</p>

<p>"What is it, Mollie Mavourneen?" she
asked nervously, using the name of their
childhood.</p>

<p>Then before either woman replied: "Oh,
I remember," she said faintly. "There
was a dreadful lot of smoke in my room and
I got to the door somehow. Bobbin was
there and I can't recall anything else."</p>

<p>This time Polly's fingers clung tightly.</p>

<p>"Was any one injured? Was your lovely
house burned down?" she inquired.</p>

<p>But Mollie could only shake her head,
while the tears ran slowly down her soft
cheeks.</p>

<p>However, Betty spoke reassuringly. "It
is all right, Polly dear. No one is in the
least hurt. We were afraid for a while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
you had been stifled by the smoke, but you
are perfectly well now. And Billy says
the house has been saved. Of course, it
has been a good deal damaged inside, but
that can soon be restored."</p>

<p>Polly smiled. "Then for goodness sake
do put Mollie to bed! She looks like a
ghost and I am terribly sleepy myself.
I have been ever since eight o'clock last
night and I've no doubt it is now nearly
morning."</p>

<p>Yet, as her sister and friend were tiptoeing
softly away, Polly beckoned Betty
to come back to her.</p>

<p>"Bobbin saved my life, didn't she?" she
inquired gently. "I don't think I should
ever have gotten down that dreadful smoke-filled
hall except for her."</p>

<p>Silently Betty nodded; for the moment
she did not feel able to speak, because the
story of Bobbin's courage and devotion had
touched her very deeply.</p>

<p>"It is like bread cast upon the waters,
isn't it?" Polly murmured faintly. "It
returns to one buttered."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'><span class="smcap">Once More in Concord</span><br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>BUT as Polly did not immediately
recover from the shock and exposure
of the fire, Betty Graham did not
return home with her family to Concord.</div>

<p>Anthony took the nurse and children and
Faith Barton accompanied them, in order
to keep Angelique from being lonely, she
explained. However, her real desire, of
course, was to be able to see as much as
possible of Kenneth Helm.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the carrying on of her
romance with the same secrecy as she had
first observed was not so easy now, nor did
it seem to Faith so desirable as in the
beginning. Yet Kenneth still implored
her to say nothing for a short while longer.
In a few weeks perhaps things would be all
right with him, so that he would have
sufficient money not to worry over the
future. Then, of course, they could explain
the reason for their silence. In the meantime,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
however, perhaps they had best be a
little more careful, for people were noticing
their intimacy and beginning to talk.
Indeed, Faith's chief difficulty was that her
foster parents, Rose and Doctor Barton,
had observed her marked interest in
Kenneth Helm during his Christmas visit
with them and had asked Faith if there was
anything between them.</p>

<p>Naturally this placed the girl in a painfully
trying position. She was devotedly
fond of both Rose and Doctor Barton, who
were in reality not old enough to be her
parents, although they had always treated
her like an adored child, giving in to most
of her whims and wishes. But while Faith
was selfish and considered her own dreams
and desires of the utmost importance, she
was neither ungrateful nor unloving, nor
fond of deceiving the people for whom she
cared. The trouble was that she was too
much under Kenneth Helm's influence, else
she would never have consented to keeping
their engagement a secret.</p>

<p>Faith was not aware of the fact, but in
reality it was Kenneth who had made the
concealment of their affection for each other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
appear romantic and alluring to her eyes.
Often she had longed to confide the news
to Betty after Angel had proved so unexpectedly
unsympathetic. However, having
given her word to Kenneth, she felt in duty
bound to keep it, and moreover she was the
least bit afraid of him.</p>

<p>The real truth of the matter was that
Faith Barton was more in love with Kenneth
than he was with her. Not that Faith was
unattractive, but because Kenneth was
incapable of caring a great deal for any one
except himself.</p>

<p>In the beginning he had been greatly
interested, for Faith was pretty and full
of a great many amusing ideas and ideals.
Moreover, at the time she was a favored
member of Governor Graham's family and
might turn out to be useful. But Kenneth
had no actual desire to marry any one for
the present and had not at first taken their
engagement seriously. Recently, however,
discovering that Faith was desperately in
earnest and that she might at any moment
announce the fact to her family and friends,
the young man had been extremely uncomfortable.
More than once he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
reproached himself for not having made a
friend of Angelique instead of Faith. She
was not nearly so pretty, but she was
cleverer and she might have been more
helpful.</p>

<p>Indeed, Kenneth rather admired the
fashion in which Angel had kept her word
with him and had not reported the fact
of his presence in the Governor's study on
the night of the Inaugural Ball. Besides
she had never referred to his accusation
against her, so there was no doubt that
the little French girl was a true sport,
whatever else she might be.</p>

<p>Moreover, when Governor Graham and
his family returned to the Governor's
mansion it was plain enough that Angel
must have enjoyed some good fortune in
their absence. She seemed to have cast
off her embarrassment and chagrin over the
suspicion which had rested upon her, and
no one had ever seen her so happy or so
gay.</p>

<p>Before little Bettina had been at home
five minutes she and Angelique had vanished
up-stairs together and were soon locked
fast in the big nursery.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Angel straightway drew a large envelope
out of her pocket and began waving
it before Bettina's astonished eyes. Naturally
the little girl had no idea that a letter
could be so very important, not even so
large a one as Angel's.</p>

<p>An instant later and she was the more
mystified, for her companion had slipped
a long, rather narrow piece of paper, with
queer scrawls written upon it, out of the
envelope and was also holding it up for her
audience to admire.</p>

<p>Bettina smiled politely although a trifle
wistfully. It was hard luck not being able
to read anything except printed letters
when one was as old as six. However, her
mother and father did not wish her to
become a student too early in life.</p>

<p>"It is a very nice letter, Angel, if it makes
you so glad," Bettina remarked gently;
"only there does not seem to be a great deal
of writing on it."</p>

<p>Then the older girl threw her arm about
her little friend's neck and hugged her close.</p>

<p>"Of course you don't understand, darling,
and it's hateful of me to tease you," she
protested. "But that piece of paper is a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
check; it represents two hundred whole
dollars, the most money I have ever had
at once in my life. And do you know how
I got it? Our little picture of 'Snow
White and Rose Red' received the prize
in the magazine contest. I had a letter,
too, saying that though it was not the best
drawing, it was the loveliest little girl.
So you see it was really all because of you,
Bettina, that I got the prize!"</p>

<p>Then Angel did another mysterious thing.
She made Bettina close her eyes very tight
and while they were closed she clasped
something around her neck which fastened
with a tiny click. Then on opening them
the little girl discovered a shining gold
heart outside her white dress, and in the
center of the heart a small, clear stone that
glittered like a star.</p>

<p>"I got it for you; it is your Christmas
present from me, Bettina," Angel explained.
"And I want you to try and keep it always
so that you may not forget 'Snow White
and Rose Red.' Only please don't tell
any one of my having gotten the prize until
your mother comes home; I want her to
know first."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>Naturally Bettina promised and having
promised she was not a child who ever
broke her word. Perhaps the request was
an unfortunate one under the circumstances,
and yet how could Angel ever have imagined
such a possibility?</p>

<p>A few days later, coming into his wife's
private sitting room, which was next her
bedroom, quite by accident Governor
Graham happened to catch sight of a
beautiful new silver bowl which he did not
recall having seen before. Then besides
its newness it had a card lying inside which
attracted his attention.</p>

<p>"Some one has sent Betty a Christmas
gift which she probably knows nothing of,"
Anthony thought carelessly. "I must
write and tell her of it." Casually he
picked up the card and saw Angelique
Martins' name engraved upon it.</p>

<p>The next moment he looked at the bowl
more attentively. Of course he knew very
little of these matters, yet this present struck
him as being an exceedingly expensive one
from a girl in Angelique's position. She
received a very small salary for her work
and she must have many needs of her own.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Governor Graham frowned uneasily,
for he had suddenly remembered that
Bettina had exhibited a beautiful little
gold chain and necklace which her adored
Angel had recently given her. How had
the girl acquired so much money all at
once? Really he preferred not to have to
consider such a question, and yet it might
possibly become his duty.</p>

<p>Sitting down in front of the fire, Anthony
tried to forget his annoyances in smoking
a cigar, but found it impossible.</p>

<p>The close of the Christmas holidays had
not made his responsibilities less; indeed,
they were crowding more thickly upon him.
The lost papers had not been found and in
another week ex-Governor Peyton, Jack
Emmet and John Everett would have their
bill before the Legislature. They had
many friends and unless he were able to
prove their dishonesty the bill might be
passed in spite of the Governor's objections.</p>

<p>Finally Anthony glanced toward the
mantel-piece where by chance his eyes
rested upon a photograph of Betty.</p>

<p>Immediately his expression changed. "I
shall write Betty of this whole business<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
tonight," he announced out loud, in his
determination. "I have been an utter
idiot to have kept the situation from her for
so long a time. I have wondered recently
if perhaps she was not quite so fond of me
because I was taking her less into my
confidence? Goodness knows, that is the
only sensible thing for a man and wife to
do! Besides, Betty seemed more like her
old self when we were in Woodford and so
perhaps I can make her understand how I
hate to seem hard on her old friends. But
in any case this suspicion that Kenneth
Helm has fastened in my mind against
Angel must be looked into by Betty.
Angel is a young girl and Betty has been
like her older sister. Whatever she has
done, I don't know that I would have the
courage to disgrace her, but perhaps Betty
may be able to persuade the child to return
the letters to us if she has taken them.
Heigh-ho! It will be a relief to me at least
to have the Princess take hold of this
situation for me."</p>

<p>And Governor Graham spent the entire
evening in his sitting room writing to his
wife until after midnight.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'><span class="smcap">Things Are Cleared Up</span><br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>AS Polly was a little better, immediately
upon receipt of her husband's letter
Betty hurried home.</div>

<p>First she and Anthony had a long talk
together until things were once more quite
clear and happy between them.</p>

<p>Of course Anthony insisted that he had
been unreasonable and that Betty was a
"Counsel of Perfection" just as he had
always believed her; nevertheless the Princess
was by no means ready to agree with
him; nor was Polly's little sermon in
Sunrise Cabin ever entirely forgotten.</p>

<p>Naturally Betty was grieved to hear that
Anthony considered her old friend, John
Everett, and also Meg's husband, Jack
Emmet, dishonest; yet when he had carefully
explained all his reasons for thinking
so, she was finally convinced.</p>

<p>Not for a single instant, however, would
she consider the bare possibility of Angelique<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
Martins' having had anything to do
with the loss of the Governor's important
letters. She had known Angel too long
and too well and trusted her entirely.
Besides, she had been one of her own Camp
Fire girls who had kept the Camp Fire laws
and gained its not easily acquired honors.</p>

<p>So Betty Graham did the only intelligent
thing in all such difficulties and suspicions&mdash;she
went directly to Angel and told her that
she believed in her, but asked that they
might discuss the whole matter. She even
told her that she and Governor Graham had
both wondered at her having a sum of
money which she could scarcely have
earned through her work.</p>

<p>The woman and the girl were in Betty's
pretty sitting room when they had their
long talk. It was their first meeting without
other people being present since Mrs.
Graham's return. And Angel sat on a
little stool at her friend's feet with her dark
eyes gazing directly into those of her dearest
friend.</p>

<p>It was good to have this opportunity for
confidences. Angel breathed a sigh of
relief when she learned that the Governor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
had confessed his own suspicion to his
wife. For she had never a moment's fear
that Betty might fail in faith toward her.
Of course, she had never seen the missing
letters and had no idea what could have
become of them.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was curious, yet not even to
the Governor's wife did Angelique during
this interview speak of her own distrust of
Kenneth Helm. She was hardly conscious
of the exact reasons for her reticence, except
she had no possible proof against Kenneth,
and Betty and the Governor were both
fond of him. Moreover, it seemed a disloyalty
to Faith Barton to suspect the
man to whom Faith had given her affection.</p>

<p>But Angel was very happy to explain
where she had acquired her recent wealth
and Betty was as happy and proud as only
Betty Graham could be of her friends'
good fortunes. She could hardly wait to
see the picture, of course, and registered
an unspoken vow that Angel should have
art lessons when she had so much talent,
no matter how much the girl herself
might oppose the idea. Certainly she and
Anthony would owe this much to their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
little friend for even the faintest doubt of
her.</p>

<p>But Angel had other information which
she was even more shy in confessing. It
did not amount to very much at present,
only she and Horace Everett had taken a
great fancy to each other during Horace's
stay in Concord for the Christmas holidays.
She had seen him nearly every day and
Horace had made no secret of his liking for
her. He had not exactly proposed, but had
told her that he meant to as soon as he had
known her long enough to make it proper.</p>

<p>It was all very beautiful and unexpected
to Angelique, for she had seldom dreamed
of any one's caring for her in just this
particular way. And that it should be so
splendid a person as Horace Everett made
everything more wonderful. Of course,
Angel could not be so unhappy as she had
been before Christmas; nevertheless, for
Betty's and Governor Graham's sake she
felt that the mystery of the lost letters
must be cleared up within the next few
days.</p>

<p>There was only one piece of information,
however, which Betty had given her that
offered any possible clue to the enigma.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
Governor Graham believed that whoever
had taken the letters had probably sold
them to the three men who would most
profit by their disappearance.</p>

<p>Yet Angel had no experience in the work
of a detective and could only hope to be
of use, without the faintest idea of how she
might manage it.</p>

<p>There was one thing, however, which
Angelique regarded as her absolute duty
after her own talk with Betty Graham.
She simply must endeavor to be better
friends with Faith Barton. For somehow
Betty's faith and affection for her had
served to remind her of her almost forgotten
Camp Fire loyalties.</p>

<p>Kinder than any one else except Betty,
Faith had certainly been to her long ago,
when she had first come, ill and a stranger,
to Sunrise Cabin. Besides, what had Faith
ever done except be a little selfish and
unreasonable of late, and Angel knew that
she was troubled by her own affairs?</p>

<p>It was only a few nights after her own
interview with Betty, when one evening
immediately after dinner, Angel went up
alone to Faith's room for the first time since<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
their misunderstanding. She did not know
whether Faith would care to see her, but
she meant to try. For Faith had not dined
with the rest of the family; she had sent
down word that she had a headache and
desired to be left alone.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when she discovered who it
was who was knocking at her door, she
grudgingly said, "Come in."</p>

<p>The truth was that Faith was unhappy
and needed consolation. She had never had
any trouble in her life before without some
one to comfort her, and now possibly Angel
was the only person who could be of service,
since Angel alone knew her secret.</p>

<p>Faith was sitting up in bed looking very
pretty in a pale blue cashmere dressing
gown with a cap of white muslin and lace
on her fair hair. Yet she had plainly been
crying, for her eyes and nose were both a
little red. Moreover, she had eaten no
dinner, as a tray of food sat untouched on a
small table close beside her.</p>

<p>So Angel's first effort was quietly to persuade
Faith to have something to eat.
Then she led her to talking of Woodford
and the Christmas with Rose and Doctor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Barton. And within a few moments Faith
was again in tears.</p>

<p>It could not be very wrong, she then
decided, to confide what was worrying her
to so insignificant a person as Angel.
Surely even Kenneth could not resent this!</p>

<p>So Faith revealed the fact that she had
recently received a letter from Rose Barton
and that Rose had asked her again if she
felt any unusual interest in Kenneth Helm.
Rose had been very kind and had said more
than once that she did not wish to force
Faith's confidence. Only she cared for her
and her happiness so much that she hoped
Faith would keep no secret of this kind
from her.</p>

<p>And Faith had gone immediately with
this letter to Kenneth Helm, begging him
that she at least be allowed to confess their
engagement to the two friends who had been
almost more than a father and mother to
her.</p>

<p>However, Kenneth had absolutely and
flatly refused and Faith could not make up
her mind what she should do.</p>

<p>Without a word or a sign Angelique
heard the entire story through, although<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
she was secretly raging with indignation
against Kenneth and wondering how Faith
could possibly be so much under his influence
that she seemed to have no mind
or will of her own.</p>

<p>Moreover, even after Faith had ended
her story and sat evidently waiting for some
comment from her companion, Angel could
think of nothing to say that would be
sufficiently circumspect. For if she even
so much as breathed a word against Kenneth,
Faith would probably be exceedingly angry
and rally to his defence at once. So the
little French girl sat motionless on the side
of the bed, staring rather stupidly at the
wall opposite her.</p>

<p>By and by, however, Faith leaned over
and put her arms about her.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Angel, just what you would
do if you were in my place?" the girl pleaded.
"Really, I am so miserable I can't decide."</p>

<p>Angel looked at her earnestly. "Do you
really mean that?" she queried. And when
Faith bowed her head, she answered decisively:</p>

<p>"Why, if I were you, I should simply
write to Kenneth Helm tonight and say to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
him that he was either to allow you to tell
Rose and Doctor Barton of your engagement
or else you would consider your
engagement broken."</p>

<p>Faith caught her breath and then her
cheeks flushed.</p>

<p>"Would you mind getting me some
paper and the pen and ink out of my desk?"
she returned quietly.</p>

<p>And Angel, almost dazed by the quickness
with which the other girl had accepted her
suggestion, at once walked over to her desk.
But the drawer of the desk which contained
the paper had stuck and as she had only one
hand (the other held her cane) she had to
tug and tug at it before it would come
loose.</p>

<p>Then of course it behaved in the usual
fashion. For suddenly the entire drawer
plunged forward and every single thing it
contained scattered over the floor. There
were letters and papers and ribbons and
photographs and pens and pencils and
powder puffs.</p>

<span class="caption">She Sprang Out of Bed Herself the Next Moment</span>
</div>

<p>"Oh, I am so sorry, Faith dear! I am
the most awkward person in the whole
world," Angel apologized. "But if you'll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
just forgive me I'll clear up in half a
minute."</p>

<p>Faith smiled a little restlessly as her
friend stooped to her task.</p>

<p>However, she sprang out of bed herself
the next moment, for Angel had picked up a
package from the floor which had a blue
paper and a rubber band about it and was
also marked with the Governor's official
seal.</p>

<p>Faith tried to jerk the letters from her
friend's hand.</p>

<p>"Put those down at once, Angel!" she
commanded angrily. "Why don't you
do as I tell you? Those papers are not
mine; I am keeping them for Kenneth
Helm. He told me they were of the most
private nature possible and that no one was
to be allowed to see them."</p>

<p>However, even after this stern injunction,
the French girl did not give up the package
of letters. Instead, without Faith's being
aware of her intention, she kept edging
nearer and nearer toward the door which
led into the hall and so farther along to
Betty's and Governor Graham's rooms.
She remembered that they had also gone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
up-stairs together after dinner. And her
hope was that they had not yet left the
house.</p>

<p>Then suddenly she turned, and running
faster than she ever had since her lameness
she got out of Faith's bedroom and was on
her way to her desired destination.</p>

<p>Moreover, for the moment Faith made no
effort to follow her, for she believed Angel
to have lost her senses.</p>

<p>Why should she desire to run away with
Kenneth Helm's private papers? Faith
could even now hear Angel's cane tapping
its way rapidly along the hall.</p>

<p>Then she ran to the door and stuck her
head out, calling the other girl to return.
She didn't quite dare follow her, for she
had on only her night-dress and dressing
gown and the servants or Governor Graham
might probably see her.</p>

<p>For another half hour Faith had to
remain in anger and suspense. Of course,
she dressed as quickly as possible and
went to Angel's room, but Angel was not
there, neither could she be discovered in
either of the children's nurseries or in
any room on the ground floor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>At last in desperation Faith knocked on
Mrs. Graham's sitting room door. It was
Betty herself who answered the knock,
although Faith caught a glimpse of Angelique
Martins standing with the Governor
under a rose-colored electric light and
thought they both looked unusually cheerful.</p>

<p>Moreover, it was Betty and not Angel
who returned to the bedroom with Faith.</p>

<p>Just as carefully and as kindly as she
could Betty then explained the importance
of Angel's discovery to her guest. She
said that it was very hard indeed for them
to believe that Kenneth Helm had stolen
these letters, since Governor Graham had
felt every confidence in him. However,
if Faith declared that Kenneth had given
her the letters for safe-keeping, there was
nothing else for them to believe. He must
have demanded a larger sum of money for
the papers than the other men were willing
to pay him. Therefore, it had evidently
been his intention to keep them until the
last moment in order to accomplish his end.</p>

<p>Of course, this statement of Betty
Graham's at the time was only a surmise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
on the part of her husband, notwithstanding
it turned out to be the correct one.</p>

<p>For Kenneth Helm finally confessed the
truth himself in the face of the evidence
which Governor Graham held against him.
His only excuse was the dangerous and
disastrous one that he had longed to grow
rich sooner than he could with the everyday
grind of a business career.</p>

<p>So, after all, Faith Barton wrote her letter
on the same evening she had intended.
Betty's and Angel's and Governor Graham's
suspicions of Kenneth, besides the facts
themselves, were more than enough to
convince her judgment, especially when her
heart had been having its own misgivings
for some time past.</p>

<p>It was in entire meekness of spirit and
yet in thanksgiving that Faith Barton
decided upon breaking off her engagement,
which she was glad never to have acknowledged
to any one save Angelique Martins.
Angel, she knew, would never betray her.
Nevertheless, before Faith had been at
home twenty-four hours she had confessed
the entire story to Rose Barton and together
they had wept over her fortunate escape.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'><span class="smcap">Finis</span><br /><br /><br /></div>


<div class='cap'>POLLY O'NEILL was on her sister's
front porch reading a letter from
Doctor Sylvia Wharton. It was now
spring time.</div>

<p>Sylvia had written that Bobbin was
getting on at school in the most amazing
fashion. Not only could she now pronounce
Polly's name but hundreds of others,
and she could certainly hear better than she
had several months before.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Polly let the letter slide
out of her hand and the tears came to her
eyes. She was not sad, however, only so
extremely glad for Bobbin's sake and
for her own.</p>

<p>"After all, perhaps I am not so entirely
selfish a human being as some persons
believe me," she announced to herself with
a shrug of her shoulders. "For at least
one little girl in this world does not think
so, and never shall."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Polly closed her eyes and fell to
dreaming. She was not really asleep, only
resting. She had had rather a hard
struggle after Mollie's fire and her own
unfortunate part in it. That wretched cold
she had taken settled on her lungs immediately
afterwards and she was now only
strong enough to lead an ordinary existence.
There was no thought of her acting again
until the next fall.</p>

<p>She was not yet feeling particularly
vigorous, so now although she plainly
heard the sound of a man's footsteps
approaching the veranda, she made no
effort to open her eyes. It was probably
Billy or one of his farm men. If a question
should be asked of her then would come the
time for answering it.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she had not expected that
the man would walk deliberately up to her
and then stand in front of her without
saying a word.</p>

<p>Miss O'Neill felt annoyed and her cheeks
flamed with the two bright spots of color
always characteristic of her. Notwithstanding,
she opened her eyes coldly and
calmly, haughtily she hoped.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>The intruder did not flinch. He merely
continued gazing at her and still without
speaking.</p>

<p>But Polly's flush burned deeper, although
she also said nothing.</p>

<p>"I had to come, Miss Polly," Richard
Hunt announced at last.</p>

<p>Polly motioned to a chair near by.
"You were good&mdash;to trouble," she returned
slowly. "It has been four months since
I saw you last and asked you to come; and
since then I have very nearly died."</p>

<p>Then she smiled and held out her hand
with the utmost friendliness.</p>

<p>"Forgive me," she begged. "I am glad
to see you at any time. I am afraid I am
behaving like the preacher who reproaches
the members of his congregation for not
doing their duty and attending service on the
very Sundays when they have shown up."</p>

<p>But Richard Hunt would not be frivolous.</p>

<p>"Have you wanted to see me?" he asked
gravely.</p>

<p>Polly nodded.</p>

<p>"Then why didn't you write or have some
one tell me? I would have come across
the world if I had known," he replied.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>In return Polly shrugged her shoulders.
"I did everything I could when we were in
Colorado to persuade you to be friends with
me again. I behaved without the least
pride; I almost begged you to be kind to
me. Of course you were very nice then and
interested in Bobbin, but I could not go on
forever pleading for your friendship. Still
I thought at least when you heard I was ill
that you might be sorry."</p>

<p>Then to her own complete chagrin Polly
felt her eyes filling with tears.</p>

<p>How big and strong and restful Richard
Hunt looked! Why had she not had the
sense to have married him in the days when
he had cared for her? Somehow she
believed that her life would have been ever
so much happier and more satisfying. She
could have gone on with her work too,
because no one in the world except Richard
Hunt had ever understood how much of her
heart was wrapped up in it&mdash;perhaps
because he was an actor himself and loved
his own art.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, Polly realized that she
could scarcely cry before her visitor for
his affection, which she had so deliberately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
thrown away a good many years before.
Moreover, what would Mollie think of her
bad manners toward their guest?</p>

<p>Slowly she got up from her chair.</p>

<p>"Do come into the house with me and
see my sister, Mr. Hunt?" she said
graciously. "And you must stay and have
lunch with us, or even longer if you will.
I am sure my brother-in-law will be more
than happy to meet you again."</p>

<p>But Richard Hunt did not stir. "Please
sit down again, Polly," he urged more
gently. "You don't look strong enough
to be walking about alone. I want to
explain to you why I have seemed unappreciative
of your friendliness. You will
have to understand this in the future as
well as now, for possibly after today I shall
not see you again."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Polly exclaimed a little huskily,
and fortunately she could not see how
white her own face had turned. However,
at this moment her companion was not
looking at her.</p>

<p>"I can't be your friend, because I happen
still to be too much in love with you for
mere friendship," Richard Hunt continued<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
in the quiet, self-contained fashion that had
always made so strong an impression upon
his companion. "I know that I have had
many years to get over this feeling for you,
Polly, and that I should not trouble you by
mentioning my love again. Only I want
you to forgive me and to realize why I may
have seemed not to appreciate your wish
to be friends."</p>

<p>But Polly was now smiling through her
tears and holding out both hands in her
old irrepressible Irish fashion that neither
the years nor circumstances could change.</p>

<p>"But I don't want to be just friends with
you either, Richard, if you are still willing
for me to be something more after the way
I have behaved," she whispered. "You
see I only pretended I wanted to be your
friend so you would not give me up altogether."</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
